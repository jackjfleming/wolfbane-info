== Tips & Tricks ==

* The Housekeeper is deceptively powerful. Even though you don't gain information on the evil players, you can confirm the identity of a good player. This player should be your focus for the game, because if they have great information, then you have that information too. If they have a useful ability that they choose to use, you can help them use it wisely.

* When the Housekeeper  is poisoned or is actually the {{Good|Village Idiot}}, they will often get information that is easy to figure out is incorrect—at least compared to other characters. While the {{Good|Chef}} has no clue as to whether their "1" is incorrect, if both of the players the Storyteller pointed at tell you they're a different character to the one the Storyteller showed you, it is likely that you are the {{Good|Village Idiot}} or poisoned. You can use this information to your team's advantage: if you know you are the {{Good|Village Idiot}}, you know nobody else is; if you think you were poisoned on the first night, nobody else could have been. Furthermore, if your information seems like it's correct, it probably is, because of how easy it is to tell when it's wrong.

* You know that of the two players you are shown, one must be the Townsfolk you are shown. Importantly, this means that you know that the person you see is not the {{Good|Village Idiot}}.

* To find out which of the two players is the Townsfolk, either ask the group publicly or have a private conversation with each player individually. It is usually best to reveal what you know before the Townsfolk in question says who they are so they trust you more.

* If you share your information on the first day, and speak up quickly, the good team has some solid information to begin with. This is particularly useful if you confirm another information-receiving Townsfolk like the {{Good|Empath}} or the {{Good|Seer}}.

* Waiting until the final day - or at least very late in the game - to share your information with the group can also be very useful. If you can keep the Townsfolk that you know alive until the final day, then you know one player who is not the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}! This can either make the Demon player obvious to you, or at least reduce the possible Demon players down to 1 in 2 instead of 1 in 3.

* Talk to the Townsfolk player that you know, and secretly let them know that you know who they are. This way, you can hopefully form an alliance, and can come to each other's defence if either of you are nominated for execution, whilst avoiding telling the group (and therefore the evil team) who the other is. This is particularly useful if you learn a character that the Demon really wants to attack, like the {{Good|Seer}}, or even a character that the Demon wants to avoid attacking at all costs, like the {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} or the {{Good|Soldier}}.

* After talking to the Townsfolk that you know in private, and confirming who they are, you can tell the group that they are a different character than they actually are. This strategy is useful if you want to protect a powerful Townsfolk from characters like the {{Evil|Poisoner}}, or to trick evil players into attacking a Townsfolk that has already used their ability, such as the {{Good|Chef}}.

* You can claim to be a more powerful character than you actually are. You start with all the information you're going to get, so if the demon kills you, they aren't killing the {{Good|Hunter}} or the {{Good|Seer}}. You may also want to consider nominating a {{Good|New in Town}}, and confirming yourself, the {{Good|New in Town}}, and the Townsfolk you were shown all to be good.

* Sometimes the Storyteller will point to evil players as possible Townsfolk to you. If you think this might be the case, don't say directly which Townsfolk you know to be in play. You might instead state a false Townsfolk character to try and trick evil players into admitting to being a character that you didn't learn, or you can tempt good players into revealing their Townsfolk character to you before you reveal what you know to them. This allows you to trust them more... but they may trust you less!

* If the 'wrong' player the Storyteller pointed to is an evil player, telling them the Townsfolk you saw may alert the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} to the presence of the character you saw. If you saw the {{Good|Empath}}, for example, telling the Demon that may cause the {{Good|Empath}} to be killed in the night.

* The two of you can reveal your characters publicly to the group, without having a private conversation beforehand. This goes a long way towards proving publicly that you are both telling the truth.

* Publicly reveal which character is in play, but not which player it is. This way, the evil team gets little information, but the Townsfolk in question will trust you, and will look more trustworthy when they reveal who they are to the group.

* You could claim to be the Housekeeper and point to a player you suspect is evil, stating that they are the Townsfolk you learned about. An opportunistic evil player may pounce on an opportunity to appear good, and claim that they are, in fact, the Townsfolk you learned about, thus outing them to you as, at the very least, a liar.

* Beware of the {{Evil|Spy}}! They may register as a Townsfolk character to you. That player who you think is the {{Good|Investigator}} may not be the {{Good|Investigator}} after all...

* Remember that while the {{Evil|Spy}} is likely to know that you've seen them as a Townsfolk, they won't know which Townsfolk you've seen them as.

== Bluffing as the Housekeeper==

When bluffing as the Housekeeper, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* You would have received your information on night one, and so should have it from that point onward. You will have been shown two players and one Townsfolk token.

* Claim to be the Housekeeper  and point to at least one evil player. Then, name the Townsfolk character (preferably one that you suspect/know is not in play). If that evil player is clever, they may realize that you are trying to make them look good, and claim to be that Townsfolk. For example, if you point to the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} and a random good player, and say that one of them is the {{Good|Bodyguard}}, then the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} may claim to be the {{Good|Bodyguard}}, which makes you both look good.

* If a good player claims to be a particular Townsfolk character, you can claim to be the {{Good|Housekeeper}}, and confirm that they are who they say they are. This can help them to trust you, and lead them astray with their own information.

* Immediately upon awakening, tell the group that a particular Townsfolk is in play. Cross your fingers and hope that you are correct! If you are, great. If not, an evil player may bluff as the Townsfolk you claimed is in play.

* The Housekeeper can be a difficult bluff, because sometimes the Townsfolk you say is in play, isn't. If this happens, you can always claim to be the {{Good|Village Idiot}} or poisoned. Another option is to claim that Housekeeper  was a bluff, and that you are actually a character that is more powerful later in the game such as a {{Good|Hunter}} or an {{Good|Gravedigger}}, and that you were trying to look like a character that has already used their ability so that the Demon would not attack you.

* If you are the {{Evil|Spy}} or have access to a {{Evil|Spy}}, they can be invaluable in providing you accurate information to back up your story.

== Tips & Tricks ==

* It is vital to figure out early which of the two players is the one you have information about. The player that you know is good even if they are an Outsider - while their ability may be detrimental to the good team, they are a guaranteed good vote and also one player who you know for sure is definitely not the Demon.

* If you get a 0, this information is super powerful if you aren't the {{Good|Village Idiot}} or poisoned, as then you know for sure there are no Outsiders in the game. This means there is no {{Evil|Baron}} in play, and any Outsider claims are probably evil players bluffing. You can also try to encourage Outsider bluffs by lying about your information and claiming there is at least one Outsider in play; a Minion or Demon may jump on that to back up their bluff.

* You learn your information on the first night of the game. Revealing what you know early can help confirm a player as good, which might in turn confirm other information from Townsfolk like the {{Good|Empath}} or the {{Good|Ravenkeeper}}.

* If you do not reveal your information until late in the game and the player you are confirming is still alive, then you can reveal them on the final day or close to it, taking them out of contention as a potential Demon and reducing the number of players for the good team to deliberate on from 3 to 2.

* Because you get all of your information at the start of the game, you might find it useful to confirm it by nominating a {{Good|New in Town}}. Alternatively, you might want to claim to be something more powerful to incite the demon into attacking you rather than the {{Good|Gravedigger}} or the {{Good|Bodyguard}}.

* Characters like the {{Good|Saint}} would rather die at night than by execution. Since Outsiders are generally not targets a Demon will want to kill, you can try to bait the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} into attacking them during the night. Perhaps you could imply that they are a powerful Townsfolk, or else you can make it known that they are confirmed not to be the Demon, meaning the real Demon will have to kill them in the night or have only 1 other person who might be the demon at the end of the game. In either case, the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} attacking an Outsider means they aren't attacking an {{Good|Empath}} or a {{Good|Seer}}.

* If you see that your two shown players are the {{Good|Village Idiot}}, it is a good idea to communicate this early, especially if they think they are actually a character who receives information. Knowing that their information may be wrong is information in itself.

* Alternatively, you can deliberately give false information about who the {{Good|Village Idiot}} is - the Demon is less likely to attack a player they think is the {{Good|Village Idiot}}, which means that you can protect players who are sober and getting information while getting the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} to target the actual {{Good|Village Idiot}} instead.

* If you see two players as the {{Good|Village Idiot}}, remember that you might be the real village idiot!

* Giving away your information freely will mean that the other player can trust you, but not that you can necessarily trust them - it is always possible they are an evil player simply agreeing with you to shore up their own bluff. In turn, asking the player to reveal to you means you can trust ''them'', but not that they can trust you. Try to find a middle ground where it's reasonable that both of you knew the information. For example, you could share a small list of characters they could potentially be, and get them to pick from the list who they are.

== Bluffing as the Librarian==

When bluffing as the Librarian, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* You would have received your information on night one, and so should have it from that point onward. You will have been shown two players and one Outsider token.

* You can use your information to back up a fellow evil player and make them look good. This lends credibility to their claim (especially if they are claiming to be a {{Good|Saint}} or {{Good|Recluse}}) and allows you to work with them directly as you are both 'good players' who know each other.

* You can also use your information to back up a good player. A {{Good|Saint}} who is having trouble being believed, or a {{Good|Butler}} looking for someone to trust will appreciate a Librarian confirming them, and will be more willing to trust and vote with you.

* Naming two good players as the {{Good|Village Idiot}} can cause them to doubt their information, or undermine powerful characters like the {{Good|Mayor}}. The {{Good|Village Idiot}} is a very safe option, since the people that you pick will not be able to confirm your information (at least for a while).

* You can also name one of your fellow evil players as a potential {{Good|Village Idiot}}. This means that if they mess up their bluff (e.g. giving information that doesn't make sense, dying as the {{Good|Soldier}}) that's fine - they're obviously just the {{Good|Village Idiot}}!

* As a show of confidence, immediately reveal which Outsider is 'in play' very early in the game, but don't name your 'players'. This can lead to a good player confirming your information, or it can allow an evil player to jump in and bluff if you are wrong.

* If you are the {{Evil|Spy}} or have access to a {{Evil|Spy}}, they can be invaluable in providing you accurate information to back up your story.

== Tips & Tricks ==

* Tell the group what your information is as soon as possible on the first day. You probably won't be able to determine which of the two players is the Minion, but if you are believed, then the good team will probably have enough time to execute both players, guaranteeing that a Minion is dead on the final day.

* Whilst your information by itself will probably not be enough to condemn a specific player, it might combine well with another good player's information, such as the {{Good|Empath}} or the {{Good|Chef}}. If you trust them, you can team up to execute a Minion early in the game, which removes their voting power and gives you an advantage.

* If you have a strong suspicion regarding one of the 2 players shown to you, simply say nothing and study their behaviour. If they continually come to the defense of a particular player, that player is likely the Demon. If they continually try to get a particular player executed, that player is probably good. You can reveal this later in the game when you've gathered a solid portfolio of evidence. If the Minion is still alive on the final day then you know that they are likely not the Demon, and should not be executed.

* Instead of revealing your information publicly, confide in other members of the town secretly. Someone else may have information that exonerates or condemns one of your choices, and it may be easier to persuade them to tell you what they know in secret.

* If you learn that a {{Evil|Successor}} or a {{Evil|Poisoner}} is in play, it becomes all the more important to execute them as soon as you can! They have powerful abilities that can continue to disrupt the Good team for as long as they are in play.

* All minions are dangerous. Even if you learn of a {{Evil|Baron}} or a {{Evil|Spy}}, it remains important to execute them. Even if doing so doesn't prevent them from mechanically affecting the game, they still retain their voting and nomination power, and may even go on to become the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}!

* If you learn that any minion other than the {{Evil|Baron}} is in play in a game with only one minion, you know exactly how many outsiders there are. If more than that number are claiming to be outsiders, then you know that at least one of them is lying.

* Beware the {{Good|Recluse}}! They may register as a Minion to you. If one of the players you detect is actually the {{Good|Recluse}}, the second player could be literally anything, including the Minion you were shown.

* Even though one of the players you detect is a Minion, that does not necessarily mean that the other player is good.

== Bluffing as the Investigator==

When bluffing as the Investigator, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* You would have received your information on night one, and so should have it from that point onward. You will have been shown two players and one Minion token.

* Pick two Good players, and claim that one of them is a Minion to try to get get those players executed. Choosing the {{Evil|Poisoner}} or {{Evil|Successor}} is usually best if you want the good team to be motivated to execute them both. Good players may not execute a suspected {{Evil|Baron}} or a {{Evil|Spy}} immediately, but they might. 

* If you are the Demon, or even an ambitious Minion, telling the good team an actual Minion can make you look extremely trustworthy, particularly if other good players like the {{Good|Gravedigger}} support your information. This can be greatly enhanced if the Minion does everything they can to look as evil as possible. After all, the more like a Minion they appear to be, the more like the Investigator you appear to be.

* If you falsely claim that a {{Evil|Baron}} is in play, another evil player will need to claim to be an Outsider at some point. Otherwise, good will eventually question why there is not the appropriate number of Outsiders in play for a {{Evil|Baron}} and probably execute you. If you can talk privately to an evil player to give them this hint, great. If another evil player claims to be the Investigator and that a {{Evil|Baron}} is in play, you may want to claim to be an Outsider in order to back up their story.

* Communicating your information secretly to one or two good players can sow an enormous amount of distrust. They will often tear themselves apart without you having to do much more.

* Claiming to have seen a Minion that is not actually in play can cause much confusion, or back up other evil players' bluffs. For example, bluffing that a {{Evil|Baron}} is in play will help confirm a Demon who is bluffing as an Outsider. Bluffing that a {{Evil|Poisoner}} is in play when there is actually a {{Evil|Successor}}, can make good distrust their own information.

* If an actual Investigator has already publicly come out with their information, and you are not one of their targets, claiming to be the real Investigator and telling the group that they were one of your two shown Minions can be a great way to make them look Evil. If the real Investigator looks Evil, then the players they accused as potential Minions look Good.

* If you are the {{Evil|Spy}}, or have access to a {{Evil|Spy}}, they can be invaluable in providing you with powerful targets to undermine with your accusation.

== Summary ==
"You start knowing how many pairs of evil players there are."

The Chef knows if evil players are sitting next to each other.
* On the first night, the Chef learns exactly how many pairs of evil players there are in total. A pair is two players, but one player may be a part of two pairs. So, two players sitting next to each other is one pair. Three players sitting next to each other is two pairs. Four players sitting next to each other is three pairs. And so on.
* The Chef detects evil Travellers just like other character types, but only if those Travellers joined the game before the Chef acts.

== How to Run ==
During the first night, wake the Chef. Show the Chef fingers (0, 1, 2, etc.) equaling the number of pairs of neighboring evil players. Put the Chef to sleep.

== Tips & Tricks ==

* At the start of the game, your information is not very useful by itself, but can be extremely helpful when combined with the information of your allies. If you can find an {{Good|Empath}}, or {{Good|Seer}}, then knowing who is Good or Evil, or who is or is not the Demon, can be very powerful. This is because you know something about their neighbours too. Even learning about a {{Good|Housekeeper}}'s, {{Good|Librarian}}'s or {{Good|Investigator}}'s information can be great. For example, if you know that Evil players are sitting next to each other, and the {{Good|Investigator}} says that either player A or player B is a Minion, you know that a neighbour of player A or B is more likely to be Evil.

* If an {{Good|Gravedigger}} sees that an Evil player was executed, you have information about their neighbours. If you got a "0", their neighbours are likely good, but you should be suspicious of them if you learnt anything higher.

* Your information will be most useful towards the end of the game, so remember to be vocal at that point. When just three players are left alive, and you know for a fact that at least one of them is Evil, the knowledge that Evil players are, or are not, sitting next to each other, can decide the fate of the game. Remind the group of your vital information at this point.

* Getting a "0" means that no Evil players are sitting next to each other; look for players who are getting up and whispering with each other during the day. They may be Evil, but remember that they may also just be Good players with secrets to tell.

* If you know that Evil players are not sitting next to each other, and you believe that a particular player is Evil, you know their neighbours are Good. So, if the player two steps away from you is Evil, then the player sitting between the two of you must be Good.

* Getting a "1" or more means that Evil players are sitting next to each other. Pay attention to which players are whispering to each other and forming subtle alliances.

* Getting a "2" can mean that there are two separate pairs of Evil players, or three Evil players sitting in a row. Remember that Evil Travellers count, and this can give you valuable information about their neighbours.

* The {{Evil|Spy}} might not register as an Evil player for your information, giving you an incorrect count. Similarly, the {{Good|Recluse}} might register as an Evil player for your information. For you to be able to trust your information, you will need to do what you can to reveal the existence of a {{Evil|Spy}} or a {{Good|Recluse}} as soon as possible. Simply asking the group if anybody is the {{Good|Recluse}} is sometimes enough. Finding out that a {{Evil|Spy}}  is in play may require you to use your intuition and to pay attention to which players are dying at night. If it looks like the Demon is killing far too efficiently, then a {{Evil|Spy}} may be helping them.

* If the game is a Teensyville game (any game with just five or six players), then the Demon and Minion won't know each other, and will be desperately trying to find out who each other are. Giving false Chef information to the group can trick the Evil players into trusting the wrong people. For example, saying that Evil players are sitting next to each other, when you know that they are not, means that the Demon may reveal themselves to a Good neighbour accidentally, or that a Minion will not vote for their Good neighbour's execution and will vote for the Demon's execution instead.

== Bluffing as the Chef==

When bluffing as the Chef, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* You would have received your information on night one, and so should have it from that point onward. You will have been shown a number.

* Claiming that either zero or one pair of evil players are sitting next to each other is usually quite believable. Larger claims, such as two or three pairs of evil players, are statistically more unlikely and therefore less believable. Also, keep in mind that in smaller games, claims that there are two pairs of evil players sitting next to each other won't make sense, as there are only two evil characters in play. In general, even if the {{Good|Recluse}} registers as Evil to the Chef, there can never be more pairs of Evil players in the game then there are Evil players. In Trouble Brewing, the only way to exceed 4 is with Evil Travellers.

* Giving false information to the group can be very confusing to the good team. If the good team thinks that evil players neighbour each other, but they do not (or vice versa), then they will often tear each other apart due to their own suspicions, whilst you sit back and watch.

* Giving true information to the group can confirm some players' alignments, and help the good team figure things out. The upside is that because you have been so helpful, the good team will trust you, and keep you alive. Or, if they think you are evil, then they will often assume that the information you provided to the group was a lie, and then be operating on shaky ground from that point onward. 

* The Chef is a fairly easy character to bluff as. If you are a beginner, pretending to be the Chef can be a way to spread false information to the group, without needing to continually update your information as the game progresses.

* Be wary of the {{Good|Recluse}}! If you know that they're sat next to an Evil player, telling the group that there are Evil pairs may accidentally condemn your teammate to an early grave. If you are or have access to a {{Evil|Spy}}, you may also wish to tailor your information based off the location of the {{Good|Seer}}'s Red Herring.

== Summary ==
"Each night, you learn how many of your 2 alive neighbors are evil."

The Empath keeps learning if their living neighbours are good or evil.
* The Empath only learns how many of their neighbours are evil, not which one is evil.
* The Empath does not detect dead players. So, if the Empath is sitting next to a dead player, they do not get info about that dead player. Instead, they get info about the closest alive player in that direction.
* The Empath acts after the Demon, so if the Demon kills one of the Empath's alive neighbours, the Empath does not learn about the now-dead player. The Empath's information is accurate at dawn, not at dusk.

			<div class='example'>
				The Empath neighbours two good players—a {{Good|Soldier}} and a {{Good|Bodyguard}} . The Empath learns a '0'.

			</div>

		</div>

	</div>

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">

== Tips & Tricks ==

* You get information based on the state of the game when you wake up (after the Demon has killed that night). This means that if one of your neighbours died in the night, you immediately start to learn about the next living player.

* The information you receive should inform how you handle your neighbours. 
** If you get a "0", you are (probably) sitting between two good players who you can coordinate with and might want to try to keep alive.
** If you get a count of "1", then one of your neighbours is trustworthy, and one is not. You should try to determine which one of your neighbours you trust, and eliminate the other one.
**If you get a count of "2", then you are sitting between two evil players, and should probably look to change that as soon as possible.

* If you trust your neighbours, keeping them alive drastically narrows the list of demon suspects.

* If your neighbours die, you will receive new information on the next nearest living player to you. Getting your neighbours killed means you know more. Coordinating with an {{Good|Gravedigger}} to confirm the identities of your neighbours and getting new information down the line is a powerful combo. Even if your neighbours are both good, it can be worth executing a {{Good|Hunter}} who has used their ability so that you know if you can trust the information from the {{Good|Seer}} the other side of them.

* Coming out with your information early (especially if you know you're sitting near evil players) can help you coordinate with the rest of the good team to further check out your suspects.

* Waiting to reveal your information means that you can protect your good neighbours or keep an eye on your evil ones, as well as gather a wider portfolio of information.

* If you get a count of "1" or "2", consider telling your neighbours you got a count of "0" instead. This will make you appear to be the {{Good|Village Idiot}} or poisoned, and the evil team may be more inclined to keep you alive since you do not appear to be a threat. You could also try claiming to be the {{Good|Soldier}} or another character the Demon doesn't want to attack. Remember to come out with your real information before the end of the game!

* Travellers who neighbour you count for your information. If you're suddenly getting a "1" when previously you were getting "0", look to the newly arrived Traveller with some suspicion. 

* Beware the {{Evil|Spy}}! They may register as good for you, and give you an incorrect count. Additionally, the {{Good|Recluse}} may register as evil, making you believe you are sitting next to an evil player when that is not actually the case.

== Bluffing as the Empath==

When bluffing as the Empath, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* Every night, including the first night, you would have been woken and shown either a "0", "1", or "2"

* Claiming you got a "0" will compel your good neighbours to trust you, allowing you to build up trust and redirect them away from your fellow evil team. This claim can also protect a fellow evil player, and give you a good reason to speak in secret.

* Falsly claiming that you got a "1" will allow you pit your good neighbours against each other, and undermine both of them in the eyes of the group. You can still use this to build up trust with a neighbour (by telling them you believe ''they're'' the good one), but also allows you to gun for the execution of your neighbour.

* Claiming that you got a "1" when you neighbour an evil player, is dangerous, but can pay off. If you are a {{Evil|Successor}} and claim you got a "1" when sat next to the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} or vice versa can make it look to the rest of the group like if one of you is evil, the other is good - but be careful, because they might just decide to execute both of you.

* Claiming to get a "2" is a more difficult but also more devastating bluff. Both of your neighbours will know you are lying and are evil, but if the group believes you, then you're undermining two good players and hopefully wasting the good team's time on executions.

* When your neighbours die, you can try changing up your count - this can be used to further damn the recently dead, or to imply the surviving neighbour was evil all along. If you are trying a risky bluff, be conscious of this - claiming to still get a "2" after one of your evil neighbours has been killed might cast doubt on you.

* An Empath is a powerful character, especially as their neighbours die and they get new information on other players. If you are alive in the late game, it may be seen as suspicious. Being secretive about who you are among the players, or claiming to be the {{Good|Village Idiot}}/poisoned are both great ways to justify your longevity if the group is getting suspicious.

== Summary ==
"Once per game, during the day, privately ask the Storyteller any yes/no question."

The Artist may ask any 1 question, and get an honest answer.
* The question may deal with anything at all, phrased in any way they want. The Storyteller honestly answers “yes,” “no,” or “I don’t know.”
* It is up to the Artist to talk with the Storyteller, not the other way around. This isn’t a public conversation, and the group can’t listen in. It’s private.
		</div>

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== How to Run ==

During any day, the Artist can request a private chat with you. Take them away from the circle so you cannot be overheard. They will ask you a question. Whisper “Yes,” “No,” or “I don’t know,” to them, or if you cannot answer in one of these ways, prompt the Artist to ask again in a different way. '''The Artist loses their ability''' - mark them with the '''NO ABILITY''' reminder.

<div class="example" style="color: #5d2123; font-style: italic; font-family: GoudyOldStyle;">
Like the Savant, evil players bluffing as the Artist may request a private chat with you and pretend to ask a question. To help them bluff, you can pretend to give an answer by nodding or shaking your head.

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== Tips & Tricks ==

* Ask your question as soon as you can on the first day! Between the demon and the {{Evil|Pit-Hag}}, you risk losing your question every day that you do not use it. Using it right away negates this risk. There are a lot of questions you can ask knowing nothing else about the game that will give you a great head-start on detecting where evil is hidden in the town.

* Hold onto your question for a few days. This is very risky, since the longer you are alive without using it, the greater chance you won't get to. With that said, Sects & Violets is a game stuffed to the brim with information - waiting to hear people's claims and the information they've got available to them can enable you to ask a much more specific and deadly question that could change the course of the game with a simple 'yes' or 'no'. In particular, characters like the {{Good|Flowergirl}}, {{Good|Town Crier}}, and {{Good|Oracle}} give information that can help you narrow down where the evil lies.

* Being too specific with your question (e.g. Is Amy the demon?) will probably result in an unhelpful 'no'. Instead, ask questions that will divide the group into two halves. For example, ask if the demon is sitting in a particular group - yes or no, you have narrowed down where the demon is or isn't. Other questions can include asking if there's a concentration of evil players in a particular location, or asking about characters like the {{Evil|Evil Twin}}.

* If you don't have a lot of in-game threads to follow, you can also ask for information outside of the game mechanics and still break the town into groups. For example, if a disproportionate number of players are wearing red shirts. you can ask if the demon is among them! 

* Your ability can be used to replicate many information gathering abilities in the game - providing you can phrase them as a yes/no question! Listen to the claims of the people around you and craft your question to cover weaknesses in the good team's info, or to confirm/deny another person's claims.

* Hiding from the demon so they don't kill you before you use your ability is imperative. You can try bluffing as another character, but another option is come out to the town and pretend you have already asked your question. The demon will not consider you as much of a threat if they believe you, and will probably prioritize more dangerous targets that appear to be still getting information.

* Don't ask about the {{Evil|Vortox}} directly. Asking "is there a {{Evil|Vortox}} in play" will always result in a "no" - either there's no {{Evil|Vortox}}, or there is a {{Evil|Vortox}} and you're getting false information. To try and detect {{Evil|Vortox}}, you can instead give a statement that is definitely true (e.g. "Does 2+2 = 4?") - if the storyteller says "no", then you know your information has been compromised in some way.

* Another way to inquire after {{Evil|Vortox}} is to ask after information that can be verified in-game as true. For example: Ask if the demon is among three players (Side note: These three players should not be close enough to be your neighbours, because the {{Evil|No Dashii}} will confuse your info). If you get a "Yes", then execute all of them. Then, if the game continues, you know it is probably {{Evil|Vortox}}. If you get a "No", then you either know three players who are not the demon, or you know that one of them is most likely the {{Evil|Vortox}}.

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== Bluffing as the Artist ==

When bluffing as the Artist, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* The Artist can receive practically any information in the game. Use this to your advantage when you are bluffing - giving information that compliments the narrative the evil team is trying to build against the good team.

* Ask a question that implicates good players as evil. Some examples could include 'asking' if X character is in play, if Y player is sitting next to an evil player, etc. Every good player the town executes thanks to your dodgy information is an execution they didn't spent on your demon.

* Ask a question that indicates your fellow evil players are good! Some examples could include 'asking' if there are more evil players to your left than your right, or if the demon is sitting somewhere you know they're aren't, or even if X character is in play (when it is actually a bluff being utilized by an evil player). Absolving evil players of guilt in the eyes of the town will see them turn their efforts elsewhere, waiting time on players who are not so much of a threat.

* Decide whether your information is going to contradict the good team's information or not. This is riskier as a Demon, since if you contradict, the good team will likely kill you out of suspicion. As a Minion, you can be more deliberate about setting up a counter-argument, since your execution is not the end of the game, and if you manage to convince the group of something false in the meantime, all the better!

* Beware of the {{Evil|Vortox}} - if you know one is in play, you'll have to be careful about giving 'true' information, since the {{Evil|Vortox}} would make your 'good' information false.

* Don't reveal this bluff right away - in the early game, an Artist who has asked their question is prime bait for a mercy execution to appease a potential {{Evil|Vortox}}. If you're that {{Evil|Vortox}}, that would be an embarrassing end!

The Baron changes the number of Outsiders present in the game.
* This change happens during setup, and it does not revert if the Baron dies. A change in characters during setup, regardless of what happens during the game, is shown on character sheets and tokens in square brackets at the end of a character's description—like [this].
* The added Outsiders always replace Townsfolk, not other character types.
		</div>

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== How to Run ==
While setting up the game, remove any two Townsfolk character tokens and add any two Outsider character tokens. (If you add the Village Idiot, remember to follow its setup instructions as well.) These Outsider tokens go into the bag instead of the Townsfolk tokens.

== Examples ==

			<div class='example'>
				The game is being set up for seven players, with five Townsfolk, one Minion, and one Demon. Because the Minion is the Baron, the Storyteller removes two Townsfolk tokens and adds a {{Good|Saint}} and a {{Good|Butler}} token. In total, three Townsfolk, two Outsider, one Minion, and one Demon tokens go in the bag for the players to draw from.
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				The game is being set up for fifteen players, with nine Townsfolk, two Outsiders, three Minions, and one Demon. Because the Baron is in play, the Storyteller must add a {{Good|Village Idiot}} and a {{Good|Recluse}}. So, they remove the {{Good|Bodyguard}} token and add a {{Good|Recluse}} token. Then, instead of adding the {{Good|Village Idiot}} character token, they add the {{Good|Village Idiot}}'s “Is the Village Idiot” reminder token to the Grimoire... because this game, one player isn’t a Townsfolk—they are an Outsider: the {{Good|Village Idiot}}. All these character tokens go into the bag for the players to draw from.

== Tips & Tricks ==

* Your ability is brought into effect before the game even begins. This means that you have absolutely no responsibility other than to help your Demon win! Have fun! Deliberately claim to be in-play Townsfolk to make them look evil! Tell lies! Make good players look evil and evil players look good by muckraking, double bluffing, or creative tomfoolery. You are emboldened to do whatever you want, since you have nothing to lose!

* Since you add Outsiders to the game, and those players will almost always publicly claim to be Outsiders, claiming to be an Outsider as well causes havoc. If a {{Good|Village Idiot}} is in play, only you and a real Outsider have claimed to be Outsiders - in this situation, the good team will know that a Baron is in play, but will think that you are actually an Outsider, since there appear to be 2 more Outsiders than usual. If, however, there is no {{Good|Village Idiot}} in play, then there will appear to be three more Outsiders than usual in the game, and the good team will probably want to execute all three Outsiders, since they know that at least one is evil - and being responsible for the executions of three players (including yourself) is a great way to start any game and give your team the advantage.

* Deliberately double up with an in-play character that you want to undermine. Since it does not matter if you die, claiming to be a {{Good|Seer}} or an {{Good|Gravedigger}} or even a {{Good|Mayor}} when that character is already is in play, causes the good team to look upon you both with suspicion. They may think you are evil, but they will usually be suspicious of the other player as well, and not trust any information they give.

* Claiming that a Baron is in play when there is no Baron in play is a great strategy for the evil team. Claiming to be an Outsider means that the group conversation will turn to figuring out whether or not a Baron is in play. If the good team comes to believe a Baron is indeed in play, then you look like a legitimate Outsider, but the good team will also come to believe that a {{Good|Village Idiot}} is in play, because the {{Good|Village Idiot}} must be the other Outsider. They will not trust their own information.

* Better yet, if you claim that a Baron is in play when there isn't, and two evil players both claim to be Outsiders, then it will seem like they are the two Outsiders added by the Baron, and will usually not be executed by the good team. Since good wants to keep good players alive, even good players that are "confirmed" as Outsiders are better off alive than dead.

* Throw suspicion onto the Outsiders. If you can make the good team think that the Outsiders you added are evil, they will chase their tails looking for signs of a {{Evil|Poisoner}} or {{Evil|Successor}}!

* Be a patsy. If you are executed, the Demon is not. Don't be afraid to die this way, since it gives the Demon a day of safety. Furthermore, if you can look so execution-worthy that characters like the {{Good|Hunter}} or {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} use their ability on you, then at least they are not using it on the Demon. Even if you nominate the {{Good|New in Town}}, you might look evil, but it prevents the Demon from doing so.

* If you are not bluffing as an Outsider, heap as much suspicion on the actual Outsiders as possible. They will usually be trusted by the good team, since it's obvious that a Baron is in play, and will need to be killed if you are to win.

* One option is getting your Demon to kill you early on - players who die early at night are usually considered good, and you can use this position of trust to go around and talk to players, gathering information and feeding it back to the evil team, while also spreading misinformation. Whilst any Minion can use this strategy, of course, the Baron is particularly suited, since your devastating ability has already been used.

* You don't always have to be the fall guy. The last thing you want is for you to look evil and have the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} to kill themselves and have you as their only escape route!

== Fighting the Baron ==

* If the number of Outsiders is different to what it should be by default (e.g. You have three Outsiders but were expecting one), then you probably have a Baron. At this point, you have several options:
** If you believe all of the Outsider claims, keep them alive! These are basically confirmed good players even if they don't have fantastic abilities.
** If you are not certain there is a Baron, then it probably best to take out the Outsiders quickly; it could actually be evil players bluffing to create the appearance of extra outsiders to avoid suspicion.
** If you believe the Outsiders, but the count isn't quite right, then one of the Townsfolk is probably a {{Good|Village Idiot}}, and you should be trying to figure out who they are as soon as possible.

* The {{Good|Librarian}}, {{Good|Investigator}}, {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} and {{Good|Gravedigger}} are all characters that greatly help you deduce the presence of a Baron.

* Unlike other Minions, the effect the Baron has on the game is pretty obvious; you will soon notice if there are Outsiders when there shouldn't be, or more of them when expected. Determining that there is a Baron is actually great news, since it means (especially in smaller games) that there is less likely to be a {{Evil|Poisoner}}, {{Evil|Spy}} or {{Evil|Successor}}.

* Because they don't benefit as much from staying alive as much as other Minions, Barons will often tend to be bolder and more aggressive with their bluffs or plays. A Baron does not fear death; they will deliberately double up with another player, try to get the first nomination of a {{Good|New in Town}}, antagonize a {{Good|Hunter}}, or otherwise just try to sow chaos. If you think a player might be having a little bit ''too'' much fun with the chaos they seem to be creating, they may be a Baron!

* Unlike the other Minions, the Baron's effect on the game happens before anything else and cannot be changed. What this means is that unlike other evil players, it isn't completely necessary to execute them. Taking out an evil vote can be advantageous, but if you have a better option (e.g. A lead on the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} or {{Evil|Poisoner}}), then take care of that instead.

* Don't forget that the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} can pass on their Demonhood to a Baron! Ignoring the Baron until it is too late might put you in a difficult position of trying to figure out if they have become the Demon on the final day.

== Summary ==
"You must use a vote token to vote. If a dead player gives you theirs, you learn their alignment. You are sober and healthy."

The Beggar can not vote unless someone gives them a token to use, but they learn if the player that does so is good or evil.
* The Beggar cannot raise their hand to vote at all unless they have a vote token.
* When they do vote, they lose one vote token. If they have more than one, they may only use one at a time.
* Only a dead player may give their vote token to the Beggar, after which that dead player cannot vote. Each dead player decides for themself whether to give the Beggar their vote token. No one, including the Beggar, may move a player’s vote token on their behalf.
* When a player gives their vote token to the Beggar, the Beggar learns whether that player is good or evil.
* The Beggar can still nominate freely, and can still vote for an exile freely, because exiles are not affected by abilities.
* If the Beggar dies, they gain one vote token to use while dead, just like any other character would. However, the Beggar loses all their previously acquired vote tokens.
* If the Beggar would become village idiot or poisoned, they do not.
* The ability to donate vote tokens is unique to the Beggar ability. Players may not give their vote token to a player that is not the Beggar, whether or not a Beggar is in play.

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== How to Run ==

The Beggar cannot vote unless they have a vote token. They lose one vote token each time they vote.

During the day, a dead player can declare that they give their vote token to the Beggar. Transfer the vote token to the Beggar and privately tell the Beggar the alignment of that player.

				The Beggar cannot vote. On the fourth day, the {{Good|Bodyguard}} gives her vote token to the Beggar. The Beggar may now vote (once), and learns that the player is good. The Beggar is evil and tells the group that the {{Good|Bodyguard}} player is evil.
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				The good Beggar has three vote tokens. The {{Good|Recluse}} gives the Beggar their vote token, and the Beggar learns that they are evil. That day, the Beggar dies, and loses all their vote tokens except for one.

== Tips & Tricks (if you are good) ==

* You definitely want to learn the alignment of at least one player, but don't get too greedy. Learning 1 or 2 players' alignments could mean that 1 or 2 good players can no longer vote - this is probably acceptable. But learning 5 players' alignment could mean that 5 good players can no longer vote - and that gives evil the majority vote at the next execution, granting evil the win. Gain a vote token or two... or three... but know when to stop.

* Tell the truth about good players who give you their vote token. You trust them. They will probably trust you. Have a private conversation about your combined strategy for the future, and tell the group that they are good. You can trust whatever information this good player has due to their character ability, so use that to your advantage and let them help you decide who to vote for.

* Lie about a good player who gave you their vote token. If you tell the group that a good player is in fact evil, the Demon or its Minions may seek you out and tell you who they are, believing that you are evil too. This could be amazing information. Either way, you'll want to tell the group that you were lying before the game ends, and reveal your strategy to them, otherwise they may believe that you are evil, or that the good player who selflessly gave you their token is evil. 

* If an evil player is foolish enough or brave enough to give you their vote token, tell the truth about their alignment. Tell the group that the player is evil, and be prepared for that player to accuse you of being evil. Since it is rare for evil players to give their vote to a good beggar (but some will do so because it is so unexpected), you may find it difficult to convince the group that they are evil. It will be easier to convince the group if you can get a good player's vote token as well, as that good player will probably help you.

* If an evil player has given you their vote token, you may want to lie about their alignment. Tell the group they they are good - this may convince the evil players that you are evil, and will encourage more evil players to give you their vote token. On the final day, you can reveal the truth.

* You can't vote. So, when you do get a vote token, use it very, very wisely. This is especially important because you may have removed a good player's ability to vote when you took their token, which means that good has less voting power overall. Make your vote count by saving it until the final day, or waiting to use it when your vote will decide whether a player is executed or not.

* Be proactive in getting players to give you their vote token. Ask. Demand. Bargain. Beg. Others will not usually volunteer to give you their token, because they have other things on their mind, but will often consider it if you pester them a little.

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">

== Tips & Tricks (if you are evil) ==

* Learn the alignment of as many players as possible. Take vote tokens from as many players as possible. Even though by talking to the Demon you can learn the alignments of all players quickly, the more players that give you their vote tokens, the more players will not be able to vote on the final day. You'll be able to vote as much as you want, and that is a powerful enough ability to win the game. Good players often don't realize how powerful their dead vote is - 1 player giving it away to an evil Beggar might not make much difference, but 4 players doing so will make a huge difference.

* When good players give your their token, tell the truth about their alignment in order to gain their trust. If you publicly tell the group that a good player is good, that goes some way in confirming their legitimacy (and therefore their information), but you may be able to convince more players to give you their token. You can lie about their alignment at a later date.

* Lie about good players' alignments, if you think that you can get away with it. It is much more common for good players to give their vote tokens to Beggars, so claiming that an evil player has done so is a difficult bluff. But, it is possible, and if you succeed, you have not only convinced the group of the illegitimacy of their information, you have gained a vote and convinced them of your goodness. The good player will kick and scream and do everything they can to convince the group that you are evil, so be prepared. 

* Lie about evil players alignment, if evil players give you their tokens. There is usually not much to be gained by telling the group that an evil player is evil, beyond making yourself look good. Sure, you'll get the benefit of looking more trustworthy (and maybe even getting another player to give up their vote token), but you've sacrificed the evil player to do so. The {{Good|Chef}}, {{Good|Empath}}, {{Good|Investigator}} and {{Good|Gravedigger}} in particular are very good at using the simple fact that one player is evil to deduce the alignment of several other players. 

* Tell the truth about evil players to build trust. But do so rarely. Very rarely. Since it is so unlikely that an evil Beggar would actually tell the group the truth about an evil player's alignment, when you actually do it, it may be believed. You'll want to make sure the payoff is worth it though. It can be worth it if the evil player was heavily suspicious anyway, or if the evil player was the third or fourth player to give you their vote token. In such circumstances, building the group's faith that you are good can give you the edge and keep you alive.

* Use your vote wisely or throw it away. Either way, it doesn't really matter. What is important is that you '''look''' like you use your vote wisely, and that you save at least one vote token for the final day. The final day is all that really matters, so who you vote for before that point is mostly about making you look trustworthy so that you can survive until the final day.

* Be proactive in getting players to give you their vote token. Ask. Demand. Bargain. Beg. Others will not usually volunteer to give you their token, because they have other things on their mind, but will often consider it if you pester them a little.

== How to Run ==
Each night except the first, wake the Bodyguard. The Bodyguard points at any player except themself. (If the Bodyguard points at themself, shake your head no and prompt them to point at another player.) Put the Bodyguard to sleep. Put the Bodyguard's '''SAFE''' reminder token by the chosen player's character token.

If the Demon attacks the player marked '''SAFE''', the player remains alive. (Do not mark them with the Demon's '''DEAD''' reminder token or add a shroud as you normally would.) At dawn, declare that no one died at night. (Do not say why.)

At dawn, remove the '''SAFE''' reminder token.

In other editions, Demons may have abilities other than killing. The Bodyguard's protection also prevents all other harmful effects of the Demon's ability, such as poisoning or turning the protected player evil.

== Tips & Tricks ==

* Your goal is to keep valuable good players alive and stall the Demon's mayhem. Try to predict who the Demon may target each night based on the available information in the game and how the players are acting. Every Demon is different, and figuring out the methodology of yours can enable you to save more than one player.

* Don't try to predict what the Demon will do. Instead, talk to your fellow players and find someone to keep alive at all costs. Valuable characters, such as the {{Good|Seer}} or {{Good|Empath}}, or players that you trust, such as a confirmed {{Good|New in Town}} can survive for entire games under your protection.

* If you find a {{Good|Hunter}} or a {{Good|New in Town}}, you can convince them not to use their ability right away, since you can protect them. This will enable them to use their once per game abilities later, when more information is on the table.

* You are the only player that you cannot protect, and if you thwart the Demon, they are probably going to want to identify and kill you, so try to avoid the Demon's attention. You can do this by bluffing as a low priority target for the Demon like the {{Good|Chef}}, or an undesirable one like the {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} or {{Good|Soldier}}.

* Coming out publicly as the Bodyguard can let you coordinate with the good team, finding the best choice for your protection that night. Even if you die, you are protecting the town; the night the Demon had to spend killing you was a night the Demon wasn't killing your {{Good|Gravedigger}} or {{Good|New in Town}}. Beware of the {{Evil|Poisoner}} if you take this route! They can disable you and let the demon kill freely.

* If you successfully protect someone at night, you can be reasonably certain that they are good, since the Demon wanted them dead. The only exception is the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}, who has the special ability to die and pass their Demonhood onto one of their Minions, but the chances of this are slim.

* If you suspect that someone is the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} and about to kill themselves to move the Demon, you can deliberately protect them, preventing them from doing so.

* Misdirect the Demon about who you are going to protect. You can do this publicly or by privately whispering to select players. If the Demon believes you are guarding the {{Good|Seer}}, they may not target them, leaving you free to provide your actual protection to someone else. Keeping the evil team guessing is a good way to spread your 'protection' among multiple players. Be aware, though, that if the player that you say you're going to protect dies, it might make you look evil, so consider confiding in them that they won't actually be protected.

* If you wake up and nobody is dead, you might not have protected anyone. The Demon may have attacked a {{Good|Soldier}}.

* If think you've successfully protected your target, ask them to bluff as the {{Good|Soldier}}. This will cause the Demon to think they are not worth targeting again, and mask your existence for another night.
		</div>

	</div>

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== Bluffing as the Bodyguard==

When bluffing as the Bodyguard, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* The Storyteller would have woken you on nights that the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} wakes - every night except the first - and you would have pointed to a player.

* Your choice for who you 'protect' should have some logic behind it. If a publicly revealed {{Good|Seer}}  dies on your watch, that can be a big clue that you are not who you say you are. However, if you tell the group that you don't believe that the {{Good|Seer}}  is telling the truth, and that you instead protected a player that has privately revealed that they are the {{Good|Empath}} to you, your choices seem much more reasonable. You can come up with all sorts of reasons about why you protected player A instead of player B, particularly if you prepare what you are going to say beforehand.

* The Demon can choose to pick a dead player instead of an alive player at night. If you are claiming to be the Bodyguard, getting the Demon to do this supports your bluff. When nobody dies at night, all players will want to know why. This also means that the player you claimed to have protected from the Demon will look more trustworthy, since the Demon almost always attacks good players. The player that you claim to protect is likely to be seen by other players as the same alignment as you, so you can either ingratiate yourself by claiming to have picked a good player, or back up the Demon by saying you picked them.

* The Bodyguard usually operates in secret, not revealing who they are to the group until they have successfully protected a player from death. You can use this secrecy as an excuse to talk to many players in private, either spreading lies to the good players, or coordinating with your evil team mates. If anybody asks why you are being so secretive, the players that believe you are the Bodyguard will come to your defense.

* If you are still alive on the final day, and a player has died each night this game, the good players will probably be convinced that you are either a particularly inept Bodyguard, or just evil. If you are a Minion, this can be quite helpful, since the good players will want to execute you, ending the game with an evil victory.

* You can draw attention to yourself as a Minion by claiming to have protected the player who died last night. There are legitimate reasons why it might have happened - you could be the {{Good|Village Idiot}} or poisoned, but providing such an outlandish topic of discussion distracts from the information that the {{Good|Seer}} has pointing directly at your Demon.

== Summary ==
"Each night, choose a player (not yourself): their vote counts as 3 votes tomorrow."

The Bureaucrat gives extra votes to a player of their choice.
* When a player chosen by the Bureaucrat votes, that vote counts as three votes. This happens every time that player votes that day.
* The player with the triple vote loses it immediately if the Bureaucrat dies, including if the Bureaucrat is exiled, because the Bureaucrat loses their ability.
* Exiles are never affected by abilities, so the player with the triple vote can only support exiles once, not three times.
* Since the Storyteller counts the number of votes out loud as they move their hand around the circle, all players will know which player the Bureaucrat chose.
		</div>

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== How to Run ==

Each night, wake the Bureaucrat. They point at any player. Mark the chosen player with the Bureaucrat’s '''3 VOTES''' reminder. Put the Bureaucrat to sleep.

Each time you tally the vote of a player marked '''3 VOTES''', count it as three votes instead of one. (''Count this out loud, as normal.'')

			<div class='example'>
				The Bureaucrat chooses Filip. The next day, Filip has a triple vote, which he uses during four nominations.

== Tips & Tricks (if you are good) ==

* When picking who to give your extra votes to, prioritize living players. Dead players get a single vote for the rest of the game, and will be reluctant to spend it before a critical moment, even with your ability giving them an extra punch. (Similarly, be wary of characters like the {{Good|Butler}}, who can have their voting restricted because of their ability.)

* Find a good player you trust or who has been confirmed in some way, and pair up with them. Characters like a {{Good|New in Town}} who has caused an execution or anyone confirmed by a {{Good|Housekeeper}} are great options of trustworthy players you can work with. This also has the benefit of making you look good, as you are publicly aligning yourself with a good player.

* Watch how people vote, especially the people you choose. Depending on who is on the chopping block, players will change their vote - it's very unlikely that a Minion would vote for their Demon knowing they have 3 votes, for example. If a player doesn't take advantage of your power at a critical moment (or worse, ''does''), then they are telling you a lot about their priorities and who they are aligned with.

* Ask the town to help you choose who the person that receives your extra votes should be! If you don't have any strong leads on a reliable good player to trust, crowd-sourcing a solution will not only help the town trust you, but uncover good potential options for you to pick.

* Communicate with the town about who you have picked - not only does keeping an open and honest policy help the town believe that you have a good alignment, but it helps the group when coordinating information and votes to get someone killed.

* Deliberately lie about who you picked so that you can observe the behaviour of the player you 'picked'. While secretly giving your votes to a trustworthy player, pick someone who you want more of a read on, and see how they behave when they think they have extra voting power.

* You are especially deadly on the final night - your ability means that one person can single-handedly kick off an execution. If you choose an evil player, good will have to work extra hard to make up the difference. Consider asking to be exiled before nominations begin - a good player may lose out on the extra kick you have to offer, but at least you know for sure your ability isn't going to cause more harm than good.

* The {{Traveler|Thief}} is your counterpart among Travellers, causing votes to count negatively... but if you both choose the same player, your abilities combine to give someone ''-3 votes''! If you both trust the {{Traveler|Thief}} and have a strong lead on an evil player, this can be a devastating way to undermine the evil team, cancelling out three evil votes!
		</div>

	</div>

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== Tips & Tricks (if you are evil) ==

* Don't choose evil players ALL the time - that will look too suspicious. If you just choose the Demon over and over again. the good team has reason to believe that you are evil, as good Bureaucrats tend to change their minds more often. Choose evil players MOST, but not all, of the time. This way, evil players will be getting the majority of the triple votes, but you look more trustworthy to the good team, allowing you to survive longer. 

* Another strategy is to choose good players until the perfect moment arises. This works best if the players you choose for the first half of the game are not only good, but believed to be good by the group. Choosing good players this way builds up a lot of trust in you, trust that you can betray at the last minute, by giving an evil player triple votes on the last day, or even at a similarly crucial point late in the game.

* Choose an evil player on the final day. Although it might be tempting to choose a good player on the final day, so that you look more trustworthy, a good player having triple voting power is a huge danger to your team and far outweighs any benefits gained due to your angelic appearance. On the contrary, an evil player getting triple votes on the final day can win the game.

* Choose dead evil players, if you can justify your reason for doing so. The dead are generally more trustworthy than the living, so giving a dead Minion triple votes not only helps your image, but gets that brutal extra two votes for the evil teams' desired nominee. A dead evil player with triple votes is really maximizing their offensive potential, as long as they actually are believed to be good.

== Summary ==
"Each day, after the 1st execution, you may nominate again."

The Butcher allows a second execution to occur per day.
* After the first executed player has died, the Butcher may nominate a second player for execution. The Butcher may nominate a player that has already been nominated today, and the Butcher may make a nomination even if the Butcher already made a nomination earlier today.
* If a player is executed, even if they do not die, then the Butcher may use their ability. The players may choose to vote or not to vote, so there is no guarantee that this extra nomination will cause an execution—it still needs to get enough votes—but this second nomination does not need to exceed the vote tally of the previous nominations.
* If no execution occurs today, then the Butcher may not use their ability at all today.
		</div>

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== How to Run ==

Each day, immediately after a player is executed, the Butcher may nominate a player for execution. (''Remind them if needed.'') To succeed, this nomination must tally votes of at least half the alive players, as normal, but does not have to exceed the votes of the execution that prompted the Butcher ability. If this second execution succeeds, it does not allow the Butcher to nominate a third player.
		</div>

	</div>

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">

== Examples ==

			<div class='example'>
				The {{Evil|Witch}} is executed and dies. The Butcher then nominates the {{Good|Sage}}, who gets enough votes to be executed. The {{Good|Sage}} dies too.
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				The {{Traveler|Bone Collector}} is exiled, and then the {{Traveler|Harlot}} is exiled. There are no executions today. The Butcher does not get to nominate again, because exiles are not executions.
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				The Butcher nominates the {{Good|Town Crier}}, but the {{Good|Town Crier}} is not executed. The {{Good|Mathematician}} gets more votes and is executed today. The game continues, and the Butcher nominates the {{Good|Town Crier}} again. This time, enough hands are raised, and the {{Good|Town Crier}} is executed.

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== Tips & Tricks (if you are good) ==

* Only nominate players that you think you can execute. Executing 2 players per day is extremely helpful to the good team. Instead of 1 player dying during the day by the choice of the group and 1 player dying at night (by the choice of the Demon), there will be 2 players dying per day by the choice of the group for every player that dies at night by choice of the Demon. The increase in probability alone is enough to give the good team a significant advantage. If you nominate players that end up executed, you maintain this advantage. If you nominate players that end up slipping the noose (even if you think they are evil), then you lose this advantage - your ability might as well be non-existent. 

* During the normal voting process, pay attention to which players get a lot of votes, but are not executed, and which players don't get many votes, but are not executed. Players that get an overwhelming number of votes are unlikely to be the Demon, since Minions rarely vote for the Demon in such dangerous circumstances. Players that don't get many votes are more likely to be the Demon, since the Minions are not voting for them. When it comes time for you to use your ability, choose wisely. 

* If the group keeps failing to vote for the players that you nominate, or if the group is talking about exiling you, then you can make a deal with them - you will nominate who they want you to nominate. Staying alive is better than being dead, even if it means that you go with the group's guesses instead of your own. You can always change your mind at the last minute and actually nominate a different player than the group wants you to... but they may exile you if you miss the Demon.

* If there is an {{Evil|Evil Twin}} in the game, be much more frugal with your nominations. If the Demon and the {{Evil|Evil Twin}} are both still alive when just 3 players are alive, it is possible that evil has already won. You don't want to accidentally bring the game to an early end, and an early loss, due to too many frivolous executions. This is particularly true if a {{Evil|Witch}} or {{Evil|Cerenovus}} is in-play and still alive.

* If the {{Evil|Witch}} curses you, this is great news! An Evil {{Evil|Witch}} will definitely want to keep an evil Butcher alive, so that fact that the {{Evil|Witch}} cursed you instead of a much more valuable target, basically confirms to the group that you are good. And, if you are good, the group knows that your choices for the extra nomination each day were made with the intention of killing the Demon. The group also knows that any other Travellers in play are much more likely to be evil, and should probably be Exiled. 
		</div>

	</div>

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">

== Tips & Tricks (if you are evil) ==

* Nominate. Nominate. Nominate. Vote. Vote. Vote. If you can secure an extra successful execution each day, then an evil victory is basically certain. Evil Butchers are incredibly dangerous. If the group kills a good player each day, and you nominate and execute a good player, and the Demon kills at night, that means 3 good players are dying each 24 hours. The good team can not sustain that level of loss for long. Even if the group kills a Minion each day, you nominate and execute a good player, and the Demon kills at night, that means that 2 good players and 1 Evil player is dying every 24 hours - even this rate of loss is crippling to the good team.

* You know who the Demon is. Never nominate them using your ability. If even half the group votes, no other nominees can be nominated to exceed that tally, so there is no way to fix a foolish mistake. 

* If you really, really think that the good team trusts the Demon player, nominate them using your ability. You need to be certain that even half the group won't vote for the Demon, and be prepared for the good team to think that you are evil - after all... why would a good Butcher nominate such a trusted player? However, looking like an evil player that just nominated a trusted good player can work wonders in cementing the Demon's reputation as good for the rest of the game. If you do this, do whatever you can to look as evil as possible. The more evil you look, the more good the Demon looks. 

* Nominate Minions using your ability. Or don't. Whatever you think is best. 

* If an {{Evil|Evil Twin}}, a {{Evil|Witch}}, or a {{Evil|Cerenovus}} are in play, co-ordinate with them to see if you can quickly get the number of living players to just 3 - the {{Evil|Evil Twin}}, the good twin, and the Demon. At this point, evil has usually already won. 

* If the Demon is a {{Evil|Fang Gu}}, watch out! The Demon may change players without you realizing it, and you may accidentally nominate and execute the Demon. Talk with the other evil players to find out which Demon is in play, and stay up to date on all evil gossip. Similarly, if a {{Good|Snake Charmer}} becomes the Demon, you won't want to accidentally nominate your Demon, particularly late in the game.

== Summary ==
"Each night, you learn how many of your 2 alive neighbors are evil."

The Empath keeps learning if their living neighbours are good or evil.
* The Empath only learns how many of their neighbours are evil, not which one is evil.
* The Empath does not detect dead players. So, if the Empath is sitting next to a dead player, they do not get info about that dead player. Instead, they get info about the closest alive player in that direction.
* The Empath acts after the Demon, so if the Demon kills one of the Empath's alive neighbours, the Empath does not learn about the now-dead player. The Empath's information is accurate at dawn, not at dusk.

				The next day, the {{Good|Soldier}} is executed. That night, the {{Good|Bodyguard}} is killed by the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}.

	</div>

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">

== Tips & Tricks ==

* You get information based on the state of the game when you wake up (after the Demon has killed that night). This means that if one of your neighbours died in the night, you immediately start to learn about the next living player.

* The information you receive should inform how you handle your neighbours. 
** If you get a "0", you are (probably) sitting between two good players who you can coordinate with and might want to try to keep alive.
** If you get a count of "1", then one of your neighbours is trustworthy, and one is not. You should try to determine which one of your neighbours you trust, and eliminate the other one.
**If you get a count of "2", then you are sitting between two evil players, and should probably look to change that as soon as possible.

* If you trust your neighbours, keeping them alive drastically narrows the list of demon suspects.

* If your neighbours die, you will receive new information on the next nearest living player to you. Getting your neighbours killed means you know more. Coordinating with an {{Good|Gravedigger}} to confirm the identities of your neighbours and getting new information down the line is a powerful combo. Even if your neighbours are both good, it can be worth executing a {{Good|Hunter}} who has used their ability so that you know if you can trust the information from the {{Good|Seer}} the other side of them.

* Coming out with your information early (especially if you know you're sitting near evil players) can help you coordinate with the rest of the good team to further check out your suspects.

* Waiting to reveal your information means that you can protect your good neighbours or keep an eye on your evil ones, as well as gather a wider portfolio of information.

* If you get a count of "1" or "2", consider telling your neighbours you got a count of "0" instead. This will make you appear to be the {{Good|Village Idiot}} or poisoned, and the evil team may be more inclined to keep you alive since you do not appear to be a threat. You could also try claiming to be the {{Good|Soldier}} or another character the Demon doesn't want to attack. Remember to come out with your real information before the end of the game!

* Travellers who neighbour you count for your information. If you're suddenly getting a "1" when previously you were getting "0", look to the newly arrived Traveller with some suspicion. 

* Beware the {{Evil|Spy}}! They may register as good for you, and give you an incorrect count. Additionally, the {{Good|Recluse}} may register as evil, making you believe you are sitting next to an evil player when that is not actually the case.

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== Bluffing as the Empath==

When bluffing as the Empath, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* Every night, including the first night, you would have been woken and shown either a "0", "1", or "2"

* Claiming you got a "0" will compel your good neighbours to trust you, allowing you to build up trust and redirect them away from your fellow evil team. This claim can also protect a fellow evil player, and give you a good reason to speak in secret.

* Falsly claiming that you got a "1" will allow you pit your good neighbours against each other, and undermine both of them in the eyes of the group. You can still use this to build up trust with a neighbour (by telling them you believe ''they're'' the good one), but also allows you to gun for the execution of your neighbour.

* Claiming that you got a "1" when you neighbour an evil player, is dangerous, but can pay off. If you are a {{Evil|Successor}} and claim you got a "1" when sat next to the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} or vice versa can make it look to the rest of the group like if one of you is evil, the other is good - but be careful, because they might just decide to execute both of you.

* Claiming to get a "2" is a more difficult but also more devastating bluff. Both of your neighbours will know you are lying and are evil, but if the group believes you, then you're undermining two good players and hopefully wasting the good team's time on executions.

* When your neighbours die, you can try changing up your count - this can be used to further damn the recently dead, or to imply the surviving neighbour was evil all along. If you are trying a risky bluff, be conscious of this - claiming to still get a "2" after one of your evil neighbours has been killed might cast doubt on you.

* An Empath is a powerful character, especially as their neighbours die and they get new information on other players. If you are alive in the late game, it may be seen as suspicious. Being secretive about who you are among the players, or claiming to be the {{Good|Village Idiot}}/poisoned are both great ways to justify your longevity if the group is getting suspicious.

== Summary ==
"You & an opposing player know each other. If the good player is executed, evil wins. Good can't win if you both live."

The Evil Twin mirrors a good character, so that the players don't know which twin is good and which twin is evil.
* The Evil Twin is paired with a good player, chosen by the Storyteller, called the Good Twin.
* On the first night, the Evil Twin and Good Twin both wake, make eye contact, and learn each other’s character.
* If the Good Twin is executed, evil wins. If the Evil Twin is executed, the game continues. A dead Evil Twin has no ability, so evil doesn’t win if the Good Twin is later executed. 
* Good cannot win while both twins are alive. Even if the Demon is killed, the game continues. Good will need to kill the Evil Twin as well as the Demon to win.
* If a good player is turned into an Evil Twin, they are still a good player, with an evil player becoming their twin. It doesn’t matter which twin is which character, what matters is their alignment—the good team can execute the evil player safely, but if they execute the good player, evil wins.
* If both Twins are the same alignment, the Storyteller chooses a new Twin.
		</div>

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">

== How to Run ==

While setting up the game, choose a Good Twin by marking any good character with the '''TWIN''' reminder. During the first night, wake both Twins. Let them make eye contact. Point at the Evil Twin, then show the Evil Twin token to the Good Twin. Point at the Good Twin, then show the Good Twin’s character token to the Evil Twin. Put them both to sleep.

While both Twins are alive, the good team cannot win. If a good- aligned Twin is executed, the evil team wins.

<div class="example" style="color: #5d2123; font-style: italic; font-family: GoudyOldStyle;">
If a Pit-Hag creates an Evil Twin during the final night, either make the other Twin the Demon player or a dead player, so that the good team is still able to win.

It is rarely a good idea to choose a Traveller to be a Twin.

== Tips & Tricks ==

* Say that the good twin is the Evil Twin. Say it again, and again, and again. After all, that's what the good twin will be doing!

* Claim that you are the same character as the good twin. On the first night, you learn the character of the good twin, and they learn yours. This is a hint to help you know a character that is safe to bluff as. Obviously, as you bluff as this character, the good twin will also be claiming to be this character, so you will double up. However, since the good twin will be screaming that you are evil anyway, both of you claiming to be the same character is not incriminating you any further. In fact, bluffing as their character is the safest option - if you bluff as a different character and that character is already in play, then the good players will be certain that you are evil. For example, the good twin is the {{Good|Clockmaker}}, and the Evil Twin bluffs as the {{Good|Clockmaker}} too - the good players know that one of the {{Good|Clockmaker}}s are evil, but not which one. In the next game, the good twin is the {{Good|Klutz}}, but the Evil Twin bluffs as the {{Good|Juggler}} - the real {{Good|Juggler}} reveals who they are, and since the good players know that one of the twins is evil, they execute the one claiming to be the {{Good|Juggler}}, because they also know that one of the {{Good|Juggler}}s is evil.

* Be passionate, not relaxed. Sometimes it is perfectly ok for a good player to die, so it is perfectly ok for an evil player to play it cool and pretend to not care about being executed. Such is not the case with pretending to be the good twin. Since the game end, and evil wins, whenever the good twin is executed, the good twin is almost always very vocal and insistent that they do not be executed under any circumstances. Their situation is much like the {{Good|Saint}}, in [[Trouble Brewing]]. So, any Evil Twin that is laissez faire about being executed, probably will be executed, since a good twin would have protested more. 

* One strategy, although usually not a very good one, is to deny everything. Never claim that an  Evil Twin is in play. Claim that the player accusing you if being the Evil Twin is lying. This strategy rarely works, because the good team is faced with a dilemma that has a "best" solution... either they believe that the good twin is telling the truth, and execute you (which kills a Minion), or they don't believe the good twin is telling the truth, and execute them (which ends the game and makes evil win). Since the risk of executing the good twin that is accusing you is so high, clever players will almost always execute you as the safer option.

* Get the good twin executed, however you can. Give false information that indicates that your fellow evil players information is true. Give true information so that you look more trustworthy. Make whatever arguments you need to make so that the good team comes to believe that the good twin is actually the Evil Twin. If they are executed, evil wins.

* Similarly, if you are an evil player that is not the Evil Twin, do whatever you can to support your ally and to make the good twin look suspicious. Give false information that indicates that the good twin is evil. If the situation warrants it, you can sometimes give true information that makes the good twin look evil (for example, if the group thinks that a {{Evil|Vortox}} is in play, you can say you are the {{Good|Artist}}, and learnt that the Evil Twin is evil). Support the Evil Twin, and campaign for the good twin's execution.

* If you are the Demon, cease killing at some stage, to pretend that the Demon was executed that day. Normally, if the Demon is executed, the game continues (the Evil Twin character says that while the Evil Twin is alive, "Good can not win"). So, when the Demon is executed, the night phases continue without any deaths, and the good players quickly figure out who the Demon was - the player that was executed yesterday. However, if you are still alive, and choose to attack dead players of a night time, it will make it seem like the Demon has been executed already... and the poor schmuck who was the last player executed will be the only suspect!

* If you are the Demon, feel free to try riskier bluffs that you may not otherwise feel fully capable of succeeding with. Since the game continues if you die, it matters less than normal if you are executed. Having an Evil Twin in play, it might be a good opportunity for you to bluff as the {{Good|Savant}} or the {{Good|Dreamer}}, the {{Good|Snake Charmer}} or the {{Good|Flowergirl}} if you are not normally confident in doing so.

* It is rare, but if there is no Evil Twin in play, 2 evil players can both bluff as the good twin. If both are claiming to be the good twin, then the good players will assume that one of them is the Evil Twin, and eventually execute one of them. Since both players will be claiming to be the good twin, and both claiming that the other is the Evil Twin, then it is best that the twin that the evil team actually wants to die makes themself look a little bit more evil than the twin the evil team wants to live. In [[Sects & Violets]], to bluff that there is an Evil Twin in play when there isn't, may require that the real Minion(s) doesn't use their ability in an obvious way. For example, if there is only one Minion in play, and you claim that the Minion is an Evil Twin, but a player dies from a {{Evil|Witch}} curse, everyone will know you are lying.

* If there is no Evil Twin in play, an evil player can bluff as the good twin, and claim that a particular good player is the Evil Twin. Obviously, this player will have no idea what you are talking about, and deny that they are either the good twin or the Evil Twin, so beware. However, if you bluff well, you might be able to get that player executed, and have them look evil (and yourself good) for the rest of the game. In [[Sects & Violets]], to bluff that there is an Evil Twin in play when there isn't, may require that the real Minion(s) doesn't use their ability in an obvious way. For example, if there is only one Minion in play, and you claim that the Minion is an Evil Twin, but a player dies from {{Evil|Cerenovus}} madness, everyone will know you are lying.

== Fighting the Evil Twin ==

* If two players claim that each other are the Evil Twin, then you can safely assume that you have an Evil Twin in play. If there is only one Minion in this game, you know you are safe from the {{Evil|Witch}}, the {{Evil|Cerenovus}} and the {{Evil|Pit-Hag}}.

* Once you have determined that an Evil Twin is in play, because two players are claiming that the other is the Evil Twin, then there is no rush to execute either of them. If you make a foolish decision early in the game and execute the wrong twin, good loses. It is best to wait for at least a few days, or even to the final third of the game, before choosing which twin to execute. By that time, you will have as much information as possible with which to make your decision.

* The good team MUST execute the Evil Twin in order for the good team to have a chance at winning. And they must NOT execute the good twin, or good immediately loses. As a group, put the majority of your attention and deduction skills towards finding out which twin is which. Ignore the question of who the Demon is until you have found out who the Evil Twin is. If you kill the Demon, the game continues anyway, and you also need to execute the Evil Twin to win. Since evil will win if the Evil Twin and the Demon are both alive when just 3 players are left alive, you may need to kill the Evil Twin before you kill the Demon! 

* Compare both twin's information, to determine which twin is which. If both twins are claiming to be the {{Good|Artist}}'s but are giving conflicting information, follow each of their claims and see if you can determine which one is true. The Evil Twin is the one who is lying. If both twins are claiming to be the {{Good|Juggler}}, but their information conflicts, see if you can determine which twin's information is accurate. The real {{Good|Juggler}} should be the one with accurate information.  

* Certain Townsfolk characters can directly help the good team figure out which twin is which. A {{Good|Town Crier}} can detect when the Evil Twin nominated. A {{Good|Juggler}} can guess that the Evil Twin is, and learn that night if they were correct. A {{Good|Seamstress}} can determine whether an twin is the same alignment as a non-twin character. A {{Good|Clockmaker}} may be able to gain information on who the demon probably is (based on their proximity to the Evil Twin), then reverse engineer this information to find out who the Evil Twin is. The {{Good|Artist}} can ask directly. However, if you are the {{Good|Dreamer}}, don't choose to dream about either twin - any Storyteller worth their salt will tell you that the player is either the Evil Twin, or the character that they are claiming to be.

* If only 1 person accuses a player of being the Evil Twin, trust the accuser, not the accused. Most Evil Twins will also claim that their accuser is the Evil Twin, but not always. In the situation where only one player is accusing another of being the Evil Twin, you are faced with a choice: either trust that the accuser is telling the truth and kill the accused, the possible consequence being that you have killed a Minion; or, you can trust that the accused is telling the truth, and execute the accuser, with the possible consequence that you lose the game. It is far too risky to kill the accuser, at least until you have damning evidence against them, so if you must kill one of them, execute the accused.

* When killings stop happening of a night time, you have almost certainly executed the Demon. Since the game continues when the Demon dies (the Evil Twin's ability says "good can not win" whilst the Evil Twin is alive), then once the killings stop, the Demon is probably dead. The most recent player executed, is almost certainly the Demon - they were killing of a night time, and now that they are dead, they cannot do so any more.

== Summary ==
"Each night*, choose a player: they die. If you kill yourself this way, a Minion becomes the Imp."

The Imp kills a player each night, and can make copies of itself... for a terrible price.
* On each night except the first, the Imp chooses a player to kill. Because most characters act after the Demon, that player will probably not get to use their ability tonight.
* The Imp, because they're a Demon, knows which players are their Minions, and knows three not-in-play good characters that they can safely bluff as.
* If the Imp dies, the game ends and good wins. However, if the Imp kills themself at night, they die and an alive Minion becomes an Imp. This new Imp does not act that same night, but is now the Imp in every other way—they kill each night, and lose if they die.
		</div>

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== How to Run ==
Each night except the first, wake the Imp. The Imp points at any player. Put the Imp to sleep. The chosen player '''dies'''—put the Imp's '''DEAD''' reminder by the chosen player's character token in the Grimoire and put a shroud on it.

If the Imp killed themself at night, choose an alive Minion and replace their character token with a spare Imp token, changing their character to the Imp. Wake the new Imp, show them the '''YOU ARE''' info token, then show them the Imp token. Put the new Imp to sleep.

At dawn, declare which player died at night. (Do not say how they died.)

If the Imp attacks a dead player at night, let them do so. Whenever a character's ability says "choose a player," that means that any player—alive or dead—can be chosen. The Imp may be planning on bluffing as the Soldier, and this kind of thing helps their bluff look stronger.

== Tips & Tricks ==

* There are many strategies for evil players, particularly the Imp, that are covered in more detail in [[Player Strategy]] section. Generally speaking, as the Demon, you want to look trustworthy, spread false information where possible, get your Minions to confirm that you are a good player, and sacrifice them when needed. Take a look at this section for more information.

* Stay alive during the day at all costs. Even in games with three Minions, do not assume there is a {{Evil|Successor}} in play. (However, if you talk to your Minion(s) and you learn that there is, then ignore this advice!)

* If you are under suspicion, night time suicide is always an option. Killing yourself and passing the Demonhood to a Minion that is looking more trustworthy robs you of the support of their continued voting power, but survival is more important. You can also do this when there is no suspicion on you - people tend to trust players that die at night. Either way, if you die at night, giving false information to the good team the day after, such as claiming to be the {{Good|Ravenkeeper}}, can change the course of the game.

* Your Minions are pawns to be sacrificed! Kill them! Kill them all! You're the only one that matters!

* At the beginning of the game, the Storyteller will give you three possible bluffs to choose from. You can bluff as whatever you want, of course, but these few bluffs are safe. Since the Imp can die at night, and pass the Demonhood to a Minion, both the more passive and the more aggressive bluffs can be useful. If you are new to the game, or don't quite understand how certain characters work, either ask the Storyteller for help, or bluff as a more passive character, such as the {{Good|Soldier}} or the {{Good|Recluse}}. If you are more adventurous, more high-risk high-reward bluffs such as the {{Good|Seer}} or {{Good|Gravedigger}} can be risked.

* A very bold strategy, to be employed on occasion when playing with players who are more familiar with the game, is to claim to be a character that you did not see as one of your bluffs. If you're bluffing as a character that's really in the game, then maybe the good team will assume that you're just a {{Evil|Baron}} who didn't learn any out of play characters, and kill the other players instead. Of course, they might decide that you're actually the {{Evil|Successor}} and execute you just to be on the safe side.

* When choosing who to kill, you generally want to kill powerful, troublesome, information-gathering Townsfolk sooner rather than later, such as the {{Good|Empath}}, {{Good|Gravedigger}}, {{Good|Bodyguard}} or {{Good|Hunter}}. Removing their information (or power) from the game early can help you later on. Every so often, deliberately keeping one of these Townsfolk alive until the final day can double-bluff the good players. They may ask this player "If you are really the {{Good|Seer}}, why are you still alive?", and kill them.

* Also, when deciding who to attack at night, you are best killing the more trusted players earlier rather than later. A {{Good|New in Town}} that everybody knows is the {{Good|New in Town}} will never be executed, which decreases your odds of being executed later on. A pair of Outsiders that everybody believes are actually Outsiders will need to disappear, because they will not be executed either. On the final day, you will want at least one other player, preferably two, to be looking more suspicious than you.

* Send your Minions out on information-gathering missions. Gather as much information as you can about who is who. This will help you avoid attacking troublesome characters like the {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} or the {{Good|Soldier}}, and the problems that consequently follow.

* Talk to your Minions! Co-ordinate with them, by helping them bluff. Agree that one of you will look as evil as possible, while the other one will take the Demonhood and survive to the end of the game. Find out what your {{Evil|Spy}} knows. Co-ordinate with your {{Evil|Poisoner}} so that you choose different players at night. Let your {{Evil|Baron}} run wild. Learn if your {{Evil|Successor}}'s plan is to kill you, or keep you alive.

* There are lots of reasons why you should register as an evil Alpha Wolf to good players. If this happens, don't despair! Maybe you can convince the group that {{Good|Empath}} is village idiot? Maybe you can argue that you are that {{Good|Seer}}'s "red herring"?

* If you don't want to kill one night, you can choose a dead player instead. This can also help you bluff well as the {{Good|Soldier}} or the {{Good|Bodyguard}}, as no death of a night-time makes it look like your {{Good|Soldier}} or {{Good|Bodyguard}} ability triggered. If no one is dead after the first day, there are no dead players to 'sink' a kill into, but if you're committed to bluffing as one of those characters, just ask your {{Evil|Poisoner}} pick you!

== Fighting the Imp ==

* In Trouble Brewing, fighting the Imp is the same as playing the game for the good team, so be sure to have a look at [[Player Strategy]]. Killing the Demon wins the game for good. If you have a lead on a possible Demon and another lead on a possible Minion, it's usually best to try prioritize executing the Demon suspects first!

* Finding out who the Imp ''isn't'' is almost as important as finding out who the Imp ''is''. Confirming other players as good allows you to build trust, put together information, and build a list of suspects... but it also means that you narrow down the field for who is not the Demon. On the final day, there are usually three players left alive, one of them being the Demon - if aren't certain of the Demon but you can say for sure that one of those people is good, then that gives you 50/50 odds to execute the right player.
** Characters like the {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} or {{Good|Hunter}} are especially good at pinning down people as not Demons - while it's exciting to find an evil player with these one shot abilities, finding a good player is just as powerful.

* If someone unexpectedly dies at an odd time, or after coming under a lot of suspicion, you may have just seen the Imp kill themselves and pass the Demonhood on to one of their Minions. This is fantastic information, because knowing this person is evil allows you to look at everything they have done to try and uncover the other members of the evil team. This is where information from characters like the {{Good|Chef}}, {{Good|Empath}} and {{Good|Investigator}} become particularly valuable, since you can use this player as a point of reference for pinning down the other evil characters. If those characters are not in play, you still have a lot of options: Who have they been talking to and built trust with? If they are bluffing as an information gathering character, who has their information confirmed or protected - for example, they may have bluffed as the {{Good|Housekeeper}} to "confirm" the bluff of their Minion and then died at night once people trusted the Minion. 

* Beware the {{Evil|Successor}}! So long as there are five or more players alive, the Imp will be able to be executed and the evil team will continue. If you think you know who the Imp is, consider holding off on the execution until you have fewer than five players so that her ability cannot activate, thus stopping the Demon in their tracks right then and there.

* The Imp's ability to kill means that they can be extremely effective at removing characters that pose a threat to them, and they will do so with gusto. To protect your players getting ongoing information (like the {{Good|Gravedigger}}) or with powerful one-time abilities (like the {{Good|New in Town}}), try to trick the Imp into killing players who are not good choices. For example, a {{Good|Soldier}} or {{Good|Mayor}} could bluff as a juicy target, letting their abilities soak up the hit. Alternatively, characters like the {{Good|Saint}} (who would much prefer to die at night), {{Good|Recluse}}, or the {{Good|Housekeeper}} could try to attract the attention of the Demon - they will die, but better them than your {{Good|Seer}}!

* If you are playing in a game with six or fewer players, the rules for the Demon change slightly. They do not start with bluffs, and they do not know who their Minion is. One fun strategy is to try bluffing as the Minion to another player, and encouraging the Demon to confide in you. If they admit to being the Demon, you can out them to the town for a decisive victory.

* Unlike other Demons you may encounter, the Imp's special ability to pass on the Demonhood to their Minions puts them in the unique position of being able to get away with more complicated bluffing strategies, often involving more than one player. When looking for evidence of evil characters, keeping an eye on groups of characters confirming each other. For example:
** They could bluff as a {{Good|Housekeeper}}/{{Good|Librarian}} and confirm their Minion is a Townsfolk/Outsider. (Particularly potent if the Minion is claiming to be the {{Good|Saint}}!)
** They bluff as the {{Good|Empath}} claiming to have two good neighbour shortly before their untimely demise, passing to their neighbouring Minion.
** They can choose to die and then bluff as the {{Good|Ravenkeeper}}, confirming the bluff of their Minion now turned Demon.
** They can bluff as the {{Good|Hunter}}, "slaying" their Minion and then dying. (They can also do this trick with an actually good {{Good|Hunter}}, getting them to target the Minion and passing to them ''after'' they've been confirmed not the Demon).
** They can choose to deliberately kill nobody on a night to allow their Minion to bluff as a {{Good|Soldier}} or {{Good|Bodyguard}}. People are very likely to trust a {{Good|Soldier}} if there's been no kill, making them ideal for taking over the Demonhood later.

"Once per day, you may choose to kill an alive neighbor, if your other alive neighbor agrees."

The Gangster encourages their neighbors to kill each other.
* The Gangster may kill one of their two living neighbors. Their dead neighbors are skipped over, and do not count.
* To use their ability, the Gangster and one of their living neighbors must agree to kill the other living neighbor. The Storyteller must hear and confirm this agreement. The Gangster cannot kill without the Storyteller present.
* Each day, the Gangster may say whatever they want, and offer any encouraging words they want to either player. Once an agreement has been reached, then the Gangster may not use their ability again today, even if that player didn’t die due to an ability protecting them.
* The Gangster’s two living neighbors are always one clockwise, and one counter-clockwise.
* If both living neighbors want to kill the other, the Gangster decides who dies.

== Tips & Tricks (if you are good) ==

* Find out the characters of your living neighbours. They will know you are the Gangster. It is best if you know their characters too. Learn what they are before making any rash decisions on who to kill. 

* Talk to each living neighbour. Convince them to "give you permission" to kill the other player, even if they think the other player is good. You are good, so being able to kill either living neighbour at any time is a powerful, and hopefully helpful, option to have. You can always choose not to kill either player, even if both players want you to kill the other. 

* If you can, kill every day. Just by playing the odds, killing two players per day (one by execution and one by Gangster) means that the good team is twice as likely to kill the Demon and win. Even if you think both your living neighbours are good, it's worth it. 

* When choosing which player to kill, aim for evil players first. If you suspect someone of being evil, arrange for them to sleep with the fishes. If you don't really suspect either player of being evil, choose the player that has a character ability that seems less useful to the good team or the one that seems less willing to die.

* If you believe that both your neighbours are good, and they both have character abilities that will continue to be useful for the rest of the game, don't kill today and don't ask for each player to kill the other. This way, they can both use their abilities to the fullest. You probably won't want to kill a {{Good|Mayor}}, a {{Good|Sage}} or a {{Good|King}}, and if they die at night, then you will get to use your ability on a new living neighbour instead - your ability is also very useful, and it would be a shame to never use it. 

* If you think that a particular player is the Demon (or even a Minion), then kill players that are sitting between you and them. Hopefully, in a day or two, you and the Demon will be living neighbours and you can kill them with your ability. 

* Before the final day, request that the group exile you. An evil Gangster that is alive when just 3 other players are left alive can win the game for the evil team by agreeing with the Demon to kill another player. Getting yourself exiled means that you won't be able to use your ability on the final day, but it will be a show of good faith to the good team. If the good team believes that you are good, they will look at your previous kills as the best choices of a good player, and not erroneously assume that you were just killing good players because you were evil.

* Remember that you need your living neighbours to agree to use your ability. You can't just do it on their behalf. You'll need to make friends with them, and convince them that you are good and have the good team's interests at heart. They may not want you to use your ability, and with good reason.

== Tips & Tricks (if you are evil) ==

* If both your living neighbours are good, turn them against each other. If they both think that they are both good, they are unlikely to kill each other. Find some way to imply that at least one of them is evil, and one is likely to kill the other. 

* If one of your living neighbours is evil, they have every reason to want to kill the other living neighbour. The trick won't be in convincing them to do it, but in coming up with a good reason why. Talk to your evil neighbour and help them formulate a valid reason to tell the group since evil players that are too gung-ho in using the Gangster may appear evil.  You can even act reluctant to kill the other neighbour and claim that you are doing so only because there is no better choice.

* Get as many good players killed as possible. It doesn't matter how you do it. Every good player that dies is one fewer good player gaining information, one fewer player using an ability against the evil team,and one fewer good player voting.

* Get any non-Demon player killed. Even if Minions die due to your ability, that means that the final day is sooner, and evil's victory is sooner. Similarly, if Outsiders die to your ability, then evil is closer to winning. Don't be too concerned about what each player's character is... as long as they are not the Demon, they are probably best dead. 

* Talk to any evil living neighbours before talking to any good living neighbours. Many players will want to kill the other player before that other player kills them, and talking to an evil neighbour first gives you a good excuse to kill the good player. 

* Every so often, it is better for the evil team if certain characters die by execution. Characters such as the Good Twin (see the {{Evil|Evil Twin}}) or the {{Good|Saint}} lose the game for the good team if executed, so it is best to not kill them using your Gangster ability. Beware of pushing too hard here, though, as there's little reason for a good Gangster to not be willing to kill a {{Good|Saint}}.

* If you suspect that a good neighbour is about to be nominated and executed, don't kill them with your Gangster ability today. A death by the Gangster's ability doesn't count as an execution, and the day will continue afterwards. It is more helpful to the evil team if the day ends after the death occurs, so that the Demon can't accidentally be executed today as well. 

* Choose players to die so that the distance between you and the Demon is maximised. Since the Gangster can only kill living neighbours, the good players may have some very strong opinions on which of your living neighbours should die. If one of your living neighbours is the Demon, they may put a lot of pressure on you to kill them, and while you can always choose not to, this may end up looking incredibly suspicious and reveal that you are evil and know who the Demon is. It is best to avoid this situation by never neighbouring the Demon in the first place. When the Demon is sitting 2, 3, 4, or more players away from you, keep it that way by killing players in the opposite direction.

== Summary ==
"Each night*, you learn which character died by execution today."

The Gravedigger learns which character was executed today.
* The player must have died from execution for the Gravedigger to learn who they are. Deaths during the day for other reasons, such as the Gunslinger choosing a player to kill, or the exile of a Traveller, do not count.
* The Gravedigger wakes each night except the first, as there have been no executions yet.
* If nobody died today, the Gravedigger learns nothing. The Storyteller either does not wake the Gravedigger at night, or wakes them but does not show a token.
* If the Village Idiot is executed, the Gravedigger is shown the Village Idiot character token, not the token for the Townsfolk that the Village Idiot player thought they were.
		</div>

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== How to Run ==
If a player dies by execution, put the Gravedigger's '''DIED TODAY''' reminder token by the dead player's character token.

Each night except the first, if any player died by execution today, wake the Gravedigger. Show the character token marked '''DIED TODAY''' to the Gravedigger. Put the Gravedigger to sleep. Remove the Gravedigger's reminder token when convenient.

In Trouble Brewing, there can only be one execution per day, and every execution causes a player to die. In other editions, there may be more than one execution per day (in which case the Storyteller chooses which character to show the Gravedigger) or the execution does not cause a death (in which case the Gravedigger learns nothing).

== Examples ==

			<div class='example'>
				The {{Good|Mayor}} is executed today. That night, the Gravedigger is shown the {{Good|Mayor}} token.
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				The {{Good|Village Idiot}}, who thinks they are the {{Good|New in Town}}, is executed today. At night, the Gravedigger is shown the {{Good|Village Idiot}} token, because the Gravedigger learns a player's true character, as opposed to the one they believe they are.
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				The {{Evil|Spy}} is executed. Two Travellers are exiled. That night, the Gravedigger is shown the {{Good|Butler}} token, because the {{Evil|Spy}} is registering as the {{Good|Butler}}, and because the exiles are not executions.

== Tips & Tricks ==

* The more players that are executed, the more information you get. It's to your benefit to facilitate as many executions as you can. The good team's main method for killing evil players is execution as they are far less likely to die at night, so every execution is a chance to hit the Demon. If you don't, you'll at least arrive on the final day knowing a lot more about your fellow players and their roles.

* You do not learn the identity of Travellers; they are exiled, not executed. The only exception to this is the {{Traveler|Scapegoat}}, since they are explicitly executed by their character ability. However, you do not learn their alignment, only their character.

* Executing someone when you don't know their identity can lend credence to your claim as the Gravedigger. Alternatively, executing someone who has come out and is claiming a particular character allows you to confirm their story, as you will learn what character they are. Both are great ways to build trust with your fellow good team members.

* Good candidates for early executions are characters like the {{Good|Housekeeper}} and the {{Good|Librarian}}, as confirming their identity allows you to also confirm other good players. Executing the {{Good|Investigator}} or {{Good|Chef}} doesn't confirm any other players, but still does mean you can trust their powerful information and perhaps quickly execute the troublesome {{Evil|Poisoner}}.

* Executing a character like the {{Good|Seer}} may mean they don't get any more information, but you can confirm them and everything they've said up until that point. If they die during the night, they can no longer be confirmed.

* Coming out early opens you up to risks of death or poisoning. Waiting to reveal your information until a critical moment can maximise the amount of information you receive. Make sure to come out before the end of the game!

* Coming out as soon as possible is a good choice if you've learned something critical, such as the identity of the Demon. If you are shown that the executed player was the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}, it is very likely that a {{Evil|Successor}} just took over as the Demon!

* If an executed player is the {{Good|Village Idiot}}, you will see the {{Good|Village Idiot}} character token, not the Townsfolk they thought they were.

* If you see that a player is a good character, you can trust them, and claim what you are to them. Then, when you eventually reveal yourself as the Gravedigger, the executed players will be able to back you up.

* If you see an evil character token, it is typically unwise to be truthful with the player who was just executed. You may still want to claim to be the Gravedigger and pretend to back up their bluff, so that the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} and {{Evil|Poisoner}} might avoid you in future nights.

* A player who dies because of the {{Good|New in Town}} is considered executed and will react to your ability, so you will learn who they are that night.

* Beware the {{Evil|Spy}} and the {{Good|Recluse}}! They will likely register to you as good and evil characters respectively, as their abilities continue to function even when they are dead.

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">

== Bluffing as the Gravedigger==

When bluffing as the Gravedigger, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* Each night, apart from the first night, the Storyteller would have woken you up and shown you the character token of the player who was executed yesterday.

* A good Gravedigger may very well wait a few days before revealing that they are the Gravedigger. Feel free to stay quiet for a while, or even claim to be a different character at first, to seem like an Gravedigger bluffing as something else.

* You can make yourself look good by confirming that good players are who they say they are. For this strategy to be successful you will need to find out who they are beforehand. If you are the {{Evil|Spy}}, or have access to a {{Evil|Spy}}, then you can be more convincing in this due to your complete knowledge of everybody's characters.

* You can make key players look evil by claiming that they are Minions, or even the Demon, if they are executed. This is risky, as the player in question will know that you are probably evil, but potentially game winning, as the rest of the group won't know that you are lying. Since most of the time more good players will be getting executed than evil players, use this technique sparingly. If you find that you aren't believed, you can always claim to be the {{Good|Village Idiot}} or poisoned.

* If another Evil player dies by execution, you can safely claim that they are either a good or evil character. If you claim that they are a good character, both of you confirm each other's stories, so you both look more trustworthy. If you claim that they are an evil character, they should (hopefully) act a little more evil, and publicly subtly imply that they are, in fact, evil, making you appear to be the real Gravedigger.

* A good way to undermine an executed Townsfolk character is to claim you saw the {{Good|Village Idiot}} token for them instead. If the group believes you (and especially if the executed player believes you), then the group will assume that any information they received was unreliable. If you don't know which character a player is, claiming that they are the {{Good|Village Idiot}} is a good way to hide this fact.

== Tips & Tricks (if you are good) ==

* Hot diggity, you're the Gunslinger ! Enjoy it while you can!

* Deaths caused by your ability are not executions, and as such, they don't cause the day to end, and nor does the character you shot get seen by the {{Good|Gravedigger}}.

* You get the opportunity to kill a player each day. Make the most of it, and remember to let the Storyteller know that you wish to use your ability. Doing so every day practically doubles the good team's chance of killing the Demon. Normally, each day / night, 2 players die - one due to the Demon attack, and one due to the daily execution. If you use your ability each day, two thirds of all deaths are chosen by the good team. These are great odds.

* Pay attention to the vibe of the group. Sometimes, the good players will not want you to kill a player each day. If you go against their desires, they may Exile you as soon as they can. Pay attention and get your fingers off the trigger if you want to stay alive.

* Pay attention to who isn't voting on the first nomination each day. Minions may be a bit laissez faire, but Demon players quickly learn how dangerous it can be to vote when you are in play. Demons will usually not vote if they think there is even a small chance that you will shoot them. Use this information to your advantage! By executing those players that seem fearful of voting, you may luck upon the Demon. Or, you may startle the Demon into voting, which gives you a chance of killing them single-handedly.

* It's ok if a few innocent bystanders die. Don't be afraid to take out a supposed {{Good|Gravedigger}} or a suspicious looking {{Good|Recluse}}. As long as you kill a Minion or two as well, it was probably worth it.

* You are the perfect way to deal with the {{Good|Saint}}. They can't be executed? You don't execute!

*If you live until just 3 players are left alive, be very wary of who you kill. The Demon may try to psyche you out and get you to kill a Minion (or a good player), which will reduce the player count to just 2 players... and evil wins. Beware.

* Ignore all of the above advice, and never use your ability. Sit. Wait. Watch. Be passive and silent and unassuming. Watch people's body language and listen to what arguments they are making. When you think that you know who the Demon is, say nothing, and wait until that player votes on the first nomination of the day - then BOOM. Either you've won the game and have one very surprised dead Demon, or you blew it and killed a nobody. 

* If there are 3 or more other Travellers in the game, you know that 1 of them is probably evil. It may be worth taking out an evil Traveller before they can do too much harm.

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">

== Tips & Tricks (if you are evil) ==

* Just like a good Gunslinger, it is best if you kill each day. After all, you have insider information on who you should be killing and who you shouldn't, so go nuts. The more destruction you cause, the quicker that the game will get to the final day, and the more evil players will be alive compared to good, which gives your team greater voting power. Just like a good gunslinger though, listen to the group's opinion on what your actions should be, and don't go kill crazy unless they want you to. 

* Obviously, shooting the Demon is a bad idea, unless you know you have a {{Evil|Successor}}, or you're not playing Trouble Brewing and there's a {{Evil|Zombuul}} in the game. Luckily, you know who the Demon is, so that won't be a problem. But should you kill Minions? That depends. If Minions are looking suspicious, and you think that they may get executed soon anyway, putting a cap in that Minion's arse may be the best option. Each Minion that you kill reduces the living players by one - and that means that an evil victory is one step closer. Killing a Minion that has already used their ability, such as a {{Evil|Baron}} or a {{Evil|Spy}}, is probably more helpful than keeping them alive. Killing a Minion that still has trouble to cause, such as a {{Evil|Poisoner}} or {{Evil|Successor}} is probably a mistake.
** Of course, if you want to avoid shooting Minions, you'll have to learn who they are - be sure to coordinate with your Demon!

* Encourage the Demon to vote. Since you'll not be killing them, they can vote freely. Tell the group that the players that are not voting are probably the Demon.

* You can play it safe, if you want to stay alive longer. Each day, kill the player that looks the most suspicious, regardless of what character they are claiming to be. This will ingratiate you with the good team, because it looks like you are trying to kill evil players. You can even ask the other players who they think you should kill. If the good players see you repeatedly killing the players that they want to kill, you'll live a long time.

* You can throw caution to the wind, and kill the most dangerous, powerful good player to remove their ability from the game. If a {{Good|Seer}} keeps getting fantastic information, and is believed to be trustworthy by the good team, you can quickly and easily neutralize that threat. The downside is that the good team will quickly vote to exile you afterwards. But there are situations where it is worth it. Another example is if a {{Good|Soldier}} is in the game, and the good players overwhelmingly believe them, then you may foresee a troublesome final day where the {{Good|Soldier}} is one of three living players. To avoid this situation, sacrificing yourself to remove the {{Good|Soldier}} would be well worth it.

* Use fear as a weapon. Nominate evil players, or bluff nominating evil players, and dare the good team to vote for it. You'll probably get exiled, but you can have some control over the execution for a day or two.

* If the good players are foolish enough to keep you alive until just 3 players are left alive (not including Travellers), you've basically won. As soon as the first vote happens, kill a non-Demon player and seize victory.

== How to Run ==
During the day, the Hunter can declare that they wish to use their ability. If so, the Hunter points at any player. If the chosen player is an alive Demon, declare that the chosen player dies—put a shroud on their character token in the Grimoire. If the chosen player is not an alive Demon, say "Nothing happens." Either way, the Hunter loses their ability—put the Hunter's '''NO ABILITY''' reminder token by the Hunter token.

If a player is bluffing as the Hunter and declares they wish to use their ability, act as if they were indeed the Hunter—allow time for discussion, let them make the decision, and act like you're fiddling with tokens in your Grimoire, then say "Nothing happens."

When the Hunter declares that they wish to use their ability, give the group a minute or two to discuss who the Hunter should choose. This allows the group to feel responsible for the win (or the loss!), but the Hunter always makes the final choice.

== Tips & Tricks ==

* Using your ability late in the game is far more effective than using it early in the game. When fewer people are alive, there is a greater chance that you will select the Demon and win the game. Also, if fewer than five players are alive, then the {{Evil|Successor}} cannot become the Demon after you kill it.

* However, using your ability early in the game is better than not using your ability at all because you're dead. Most players will die before the final day arrives, so the odds that you'll also be dead by then are high. Make sure you use your ability before you die. The Demon will want to kill you as soon as possible, so it is usually best to wait, then claim to be the Hunter only on the day that you intend to use your ability.

* Coordinate with the other good players to help you select which player to choose. When you tell the group that you are the Hunter, you may find that many players reveal who they are and what information they have, so that you can make the best decision about who to slay. You can make particular use of a {{Good|Seer}}'s info to find people who might be the Demon.

* Most of the time, the player that you choose to slay will not be the Demon. This is still useful to do, since you now know a player that is definitely NOT the Demon. Knowing who the Demon isn't is almost as useful as knowing who the Demon is.

* Sometimes, it can be useful to choose to slay a player, not because you think that they are the Demon, but because you just want to make sure that they are not. For example, if a player is claiming to be the {{Good|Saint}}, and is about to be executed, you can prove that they are not the Demon by using your ability on them - if they don't die, you will probably want to execute somebody else instead!

* An advanced strategy can be to try to influence the Demon's kills with your shot. If someone claims to be the {{Good|Ravenkeeper}}, try to slay them. If they aren't the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}, the real Demon will be forced to make a difficult choice: to kill them, and give them information, or to leave them alive late into the game with everyone knowing they aren't the Demon?

* When you choose to use your ability, the Storyteller should allow a minute or so for the group to discuss who they think you should choose. They may give you advice, but it is always your decision. This period can be a good time to pretend to be "about to choose" a particular player... just so you can watch to see how much they sweat under pressure. If, for example, you really want to slay the player claiming to be the {{Good|Mayor}}, you can tell the group that you are really keen to choose the player claiming {{Good|Soldier}}, but secretly you want to see how the {{Good|Soldier}} player reacts before making your final choice.

* If you find a {{Good|Bodyguard}} in play, convince them to protect you every night. This way, you can publicly claim to be the Hunter, safe in the knowledge that the Demon can not kill you tonight. Whilst the {{Good|Bodyguard}} is alive, you know you will always be alive tomorrow, so are under no pressure to use your ability today. If the {{Good|Bodyguard}} dies at night, you are no longer safe, but if you die at night whilst the {{Good|Bodyguard}} is still alive, then you know the player is not actually the {{Good|Bodyguard}}.

* Beware the {{Evil|Poisoner}}! If you publicly claim to be the Hunter, even if the {{Good|Bodyguard}} is protecting you, you are a prime target for poisoning.

* Your ability may work on the {{Good|Recluse}}, since the {{Good|Recluse}} might register as the Demon. If your target dies, and claims to be the {{Good|Recluse}}, then they might actually be the {{Good|Recluse}}... or they could have been the Demon, but had a {{Evil|Successor}} who is now the Demon.

* You can use your ability at any time during the day. There's no need to rush. You can even use it with the day about to end. On the block? Take your shot. Even if you don't have a clue who the Demon is, it's better to have shot someone than to die unspent.

* Remember that your ability only works on the Demon. A person surviving your shot does not prove that they are good, merely that they are not the Demon.

* Be aware that the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} may change players throughout the game. If you choose to slay a Minion early in the game, nothing will happen, but that same player may be the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} by the end of the game.

== Bluffing as the Hunter ==

When bluffing as the Hunter, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* You would never wake in the night as the Hunter. Instead, you should publicly announce that you want to claim to be the Hunter, and the Storyteller will take care of the rest of your bluff for you. There is nothing tricky about this character as a bluff.

* Nobody will ever die as a result of you "using your Hunter ability". With this in mind, there are a few ways you can choose to handle it:
** Deliberately slaying a Demon or another evil player to make them look like they are not the Demon, which can be useful for setting up bluffs. This is an especially good tactic when combined with the {{Evil|Successor}}, since the real Demon can die and pass their ability to a player who has already been exonerated.
** Slaying a good player to confirm them as not the Demon; this will enable you to 'trust' them, and will enable them to want to team up with you because of it.
** Alternatively, you can deliberately slay a good player, and then start to appear evil (e.g. {{Good|Empath}}, setting yourself up to be read by an {{Good|Gravedigger}}, etc.) Since you 'protected' a player from suspicion with your ability, they will appear evil as well.

* Solicit the opinion of the group on who you should pick. Good players will be keen to help you make the right choice, and working with them will make you look good, also potentially coaxing information characters out from hiding who want to guide you to the right choice.

* The Hunter is a good "backup bluff". If you claim to be a character that is already in play, or you are otherwise under suspicion by the group, claiming that you were lying about who you were so that you could survive an extra day or two as the Hunter is believable - after all... that is what a real Hunter might very well do.

* Bluffing as a Hunter also works for good players! A Hunter with no ability is not a high priority target for the Demon, enabling you to survive and continue secretly gathering information.

== Summary ==
"When you learn that you died, publicly choose 1 alive player: if they are evil, your team loses."

The Klutz might accidentally lose the game for their team, unless they are clever.
* When the Klutz dies, they must declare a player. They may take a few minutes to do so—after all, it’s a big decision, and other players may give advice on who to choose, but it is always the Klutz’s decision. If they choose an evil player, the game ends immediately and the good team loses. If they choose a good player, nothing happens and the game continues.
* It is not the Storyteller’s responsibility to prompt the Klutz to declare they are the Klutz and choose a player. The Klutz must do this shortly after they learn that they are dead. Deliberately not doing so is considered cheating.
		</div>

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== How to Run ==

When the Klutz player is declared dead, they must declare that they are the Klutz and then point at any player. (''Give them time.'') If they choose an evil player, the game ends and the evil team wins. If they choose a good player, the game continues.

In the strange situation where the Klutz is evil and chooses an evil player, then the game ends and the good team wins instead.

<div class="example" style="color: #5d2123; font-style: italic; font-family: GoudyOldStyle;">
If the Klutz player doesn’t realize that they must choose a player when they die, privately remind them. New players may not understand how their character works.

== Tips & Tricks ==

* Like nearly all Outsiders in Sects & Violets, you should avoid dying if at all possible. Your ability is particularly nasty as it can end the game if you choose poorly, but it only becoming an issue if you actually die!

* If the good team is floundering, you ''can'' die deliberately and confirm someone as good by choosing them. Your ability yields incredibly powerful information for incredibly high risk. Knowing for sure that someone is good allows you to trust them completely, a very rare thing in this edition! Similar to the {{Good|Snake Charmer}}, your information can also not be interfered with by the {{Evil|Vortox}}, meaning that you suspect that demon is in play, you don't have to worry about your information being false. ('''Note:''' While this all sounds incredibly useful and even tempting, remember that choosing carelessly will lose you the game!)

* Before you die, work with the other players and try to find one alive player you believe is good, so you have a safe choice to pick in the event you accidentally die. (It's up to you if you want to reveal your identity before death to this player - if you do, they may be more inclined to trust you while you're both alive. If you don't, your choice will be more of a surprise, but it will look less like you're colluding with that player. It all depends on how the group is leaning right now.)

* Don't pick players who are doubling up their character claim with another player - in most cases, a double up means one of the two is evil, which gives you a 50/50 chance to lose! This includes the {{Evil|Evil Twin}} and their good twin, since it is very difficult to tell for sure which one is actually evil. Aim for players with unique character claims instead.

* If the group is keen to execute you, you can pre-empt the voting by loudly proclaiming which player you WILL choose as the Klutz after you die. If the group thinks that this player might be evil, they are less likely to kill you, which helps the good team. After this, if the Demon doesn't kill you that night, it probably means that the Demon did not want to kill you because it knows that you would choose a good player anyway.

* If you die, and choose a player, and the game does not end, you can be almost certain that that player is good. Since the Klutz is not affected by the {{Evil|Vortox}}, the {{Evil|No Dashii}}, and probably not by the {{Good|Sweetheart}} or {{Good|Philosopher}}, then you can safely assume that you are not village idiot or poisoned.

== Bluffing as the Klutz ==

When bluffing as the Klutz, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* Die! Getting yourself killed and then claiming to be the Klutz can be a game-changer. Some evil characters even naturally result in dead evil players as the game proceeds, which makes the Klutz an even more viable bluff than usual. If you are a {{Evil|Fang Gu}} that just passed on their ability, or a minion who was just killed by their {{Evil|Vigormortis}}, go all in and give the good team a real fright.

* When you "choose a player" as the Klutz, you have a few options:
** Choose a player that you know to be good, and that the group thinks is good - this will endear you to the player in question, and make you look more trustworthy to the group, which in turn means people will listen to you, your lies, and your misinformation.
** If your Klutz claim is solid and believed, choose a player you know to be evil - since the group believes you, they will believe that this player is good, and they will be protected from scrutiny for at least a while!
** If your Klutz claim is dubious, choose a player that you know is good but the group is uncertain about. This will lump this player in with you for the rest of the game, and if you come out under fire as actually evil, so will they.
** Finally, if your Klutz claim is dubious and your group is savvy to the idea that you would try and drag a good player down with you, double bluff them by picking an evil player, making them look good at your expense. The more you insist they're evil, the more the group will insist they're good!

* The Klutz is a good back-up bluff. Either stay quiet about your role or bluff as a different character, and then admit you are the Klutz ''later''. Since this is what a real Klutz would do, you will be more believable than if you simply came out as the Klutz without any fanfare. 

* A fun option for players fond of the long game is to tell one or two players in private that you are the Klutz while bluffing as something else publicly. This is a great way to build up trust with good players, as you can argue this secret reveal is because you trust them ''not'' to kill you. Players like to be trusted, and until they have information that cast suspicion on your claim will likely be inclined to return the favor. You can then have all sorts of fun - for example, get these players spreading misinformation on your behalf, confusing the available information while you barely lift a finger!

* Revealing you're the Klutz while still alive isn't optimal, but there's a couple of scenarios where it can become very necessary. For example, you might simply be trying to avoid execution! Another clever reason is when you are faced with a scenario where the number of publicly revealed Outsiders equals the number of Outsiders that are meant to be in the game - this gives the good team a lot of information about what sort of evil is in play, and makes those Outsiders trustworthy good players. By revealing yourself, you muddy the narrative, making all Outsiders in the game look dubious ''and'' introduce the idea that the demon is the {{Evil|Fang Gu}}. Finally, it's probably for the best to "reveal" near the end of the game, preferably on final day if the good team don't pressure you too much - it doesn't make much sense to hide when you no longer "fear" being killed by the demon!

The Mayor can win by peaceful means on the final day.
* To survive, the Mayor sometimes "accidentally" gets someone else killed. If the Mayor is attacked and would die, the Storyteller may choose that a different player dies. Nobody learns how they died at night, just that they died.

		</div>

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== How to Run ==
During the night, if the Mayor would die, you choose if the Mayor actually dies, or if the Mayor remains alive and another character '''dies''' instead—put the Demon's '''DEAD''' reminder token by that character token instead of the Mayor, and put a shroud on that character token instead of the Mayor.

At dawn, declare that the player marked '''DEAD''' died at night. (Do not say how they died.)

At dusk, if exactly three players are alive and no player was executed today, declare that the game ends and good wins.

<div class="example" style="color: #5d2123; font-style: italic; font-family: GoudyOldStyle;"> 

We recommend you keep the Mayor alive until the final day, since it is most fun for the players that way. On rare occasions, if the group is overwhelmingly convinced early in the game that the Mayor is the Mayor, let the Mayor die so that evil has a chance to win. 
<hr>
In TROUBLE BREWING, the Mayor’s phrase “your team wins” will always mean “good wins” because the Mayor is always good. In other editions, an evil Mayor means “evil wins” instead.

== Tips & Tricks ==

* Your power activates on the final day, when just three players are alive. You may not know who the Demon is, but you can definitely win by not executing. Do whatever you can to convince the group that you are the Mayor. Everything. If the good team believes you, they will either not nominate anybody, or will deliberately tie votes so that no execution occurs.

* It is often best not to reveal that you are the Mayor until late in the game. If you reveal early, the Demon may spend night after night trying to kill you, and the Storyteller may let that attempt succeed. 

* You might want to tell people that you're the Mayor. Winning the game with your ability requires trust from your fellow players, and being open and honest is a fine way to acheive that trust.

* When a character that's an unlikely target for the Demon to pick dies at night, such as the {{Good|Butler}}, this may be an indication that you were attacked instead. When convincing other players that you are the Mayor, you can use this as evidence.

* Once the Demon attacks you and somebody else dies, they will know for sure that you are the Mayor. At the very beginning of each morning, if a particular player looks surprised and confused, they are likely to be the Demon!

* If you intend to use your ability to win the game by not executing, do everything you can to make sure you are not actually the {{Good|Village Idiot}}. Spend the game listening to other players, and verifying that any Outsiders are actually Outsiders. If you think a {{Good|Village Idiot}} is in play, you will need to figure out who it is, because if it is you, and you don't execute on the final day, evil wins. Similarly, if the only other players alive are the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} and the {{Evil|Poisoner}}, then you will certainly be poisoned. You will need to make sure that the {{Evil|Poisoner}} is dead before using your Mayor ability.

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== Bluffing as the Mayor ==

When bluffing as the Mayor, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* The Mayor would never wake at night. You would never learn if you were targeted and caused another player to die instead.

* The Mayor has a good reason to survive at night, which you can use to explain your longevity as other players die. This makes it a great bluff for a Demon in particular.

* Come out to a few players in private early on in the game, so that when you eventually reveal you have some backup that you're not just coming out with this claim out of nowhere.

* The Mayor is a fantastic fallback if another bluff doesn't work out. Coming out on the final day as the Mayor who was "in hiding" can alleviate suspicion that you may have come under if your {{Good|Seer}} information wasn't adding up.

* Deliberately setting up a kill of a character that isn't 'optimal' can be used as evidence for a Mayor being in play. For example, you can target a {{Good|Recluse}}, or a {{Good|Housekeeper}} who has already given their information; both are normally low priority for the Demon, and so you can argue that this was a redirected kill from your ability.

* As a good player, bluffing as the Mayor can get the Demon to target you, since they will either suspect you are a more powerful character bluffing as the Mayor to survive, or they just want to confirm the existence of a Mayor overall.

* Good players are more likely to risk winning with the Mayor if they have no better leads. Coordinate with your evil team to keep confusion high so that on the final day, good does not feel like they have a clear path to victory.

* If you are nominated on the final day, don't despair! Unlike a regular bluff where you must beat the votes against you, a Mayor can call for the town to tie the vote instead, since that will cause no execution, allowing the Mayor ability to activate normally.

== Tips & Tricks ==

* You are one of the few Townsfolk in the game that can be absolutely confirmed as good. If a player is executed for nominating you, that is absolute and undeniable proof that you are the New in Town.

* Characters who have received their information or have used their ability already (like the {{Good|Housekeeper}}, {{Good|Investigator}} or {{Good|Hunter}}) are great choices to encourage into nominating you. Not only will they and their information be validated by their death, but they don't lose out on gaining any more information as the game continues.

* Characters like the {{Good|Gravedigger}}, {{Good|Seer}} or even {{Good|Empath}} are great choices if they have received a little information and want to confirm they are good, or if they are under suspicion and want to remove themselves as a potential Demon.

* An Outsider who nominates you will not be executed. Your ability requires your nominator to be a Townsfolk, not merely good.

* Don't like any of your potential suitors? You can nominate yourself and trigger your ability, proving you are the New in Town! This can prevent an evil Minion or hapless Outsider from wasting your ability.

* Once your ability activates, the nominator is immediately executed, ending the day (even if someone else had the votes and was due to be executed). Using this strategically can allow you to block an execution from happening in addition to proving yourself as good.

* If you are known to be the New in Town but haven't used your ability yet, you are a prime target for death or poisoning. Using your ability early minimizes this risk and allows you to be a rally point for the good team to work around.

* Waiting a couple of days before announcing that you're the New in Town can give you a chance to decide who should nominate you. A player being proven good, a few days into the game, can completely unravel an evil narrative.

* Not claiming to be the New in Town until you get nominated can be a powerful strategy to uncover an evil player who is claiming to be a Townsfolk, but might not be willing to nominate you if you were to claim to be the New in Town.

* If you can find a player that is claiming to be the {{Good|Bodyguard}}, convince them to protect you every night. Since you no longer have to fear death in the night, you can always wait another day to get somebody to nominate you.

* If your ability doesn't activate, this can mean a few things:
** The person who did the nominating is evil! Evil players can nominate the New in Town so that your ability does not activate, leaving you unable to be confirmed and throwing you both into doubt.
** The person who nominated is an Outsider. This includes the {{Good|Village Idiot}}, who thinks they are a Townsfolk.
** You are in fact the {{Good|Village Idiot}} or poisoned, so you have no ability.

* Your ability only triggers the first time you are nominated. Even if you were poisoned or nominated by a non-Townsfolk, your ability is already spent, and you can no longer cause an execution from your ability.

* Beware the {{Evil|Spy}}! It is the only evil character that can activate your ability, since it registers as a Townsfolk.

== Bluffing as the New in Town ==

When bluffing as the New in Town, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* You would never wake during the night. Pay attention to who is the first person to nominate you; it's only the first nomination that counts.

* A good player will never be executed due to nominating you. This means that when you are nominated, one of you will look evil, or at least village idiot. If you can, get a player that the group is suspicious might be evil to nominate you. This way, if they are believed to be evil, you will be believed to be good.

* If a New in Town is nominated, but either player is the {{Good|Village Idiot}}, the New in Town ability does not trigger, since either the New in Town is the {{Good|Village Idiot}} (not the New in Town), or the nominating player is an Outsider (not a Townsfolk). When nobody dies after nominating you, you can usually make a strong case that one of you is the {{Good|Village Idiot}}. This has the added benefit of any real {{Good|Village Idiot}} gong undetected by the group, or an outsider, perhaps even a {{Good|Saint}}, being executed because the good team think there are too many Outsiders in play.

* If you are a Minion, you can get your Demon to nominate you and then bring suspicion on yourself. The more evil you look, the less evil the Demon looks, since your Demon will be the 'victim' of your bluff, and players will be more inclined to trust them.

* Beware bluffing as the New in Town if a real New in Town is in play. If you have told the group that you are the New in Town, and the real New in Town proves themself by getting a Townsfolk executed, you can not possibly be the New in Town. You will need to get an evil character to nominate the real New in Town so that this doesn't happen, so the good team remains confused about who the real New in Town is.

* Bluffing as the New in Town, being nominated, then continuing to live afterwards, is a great opportunity to come up with another bluff. Claiming that you are actually the {{Good|Gravedigger}}, or the {{Good|Bodyguard}} for example, can be believable even if you claimed to be the New in Town for the first day or two. Since the Demon will usually rather not kill a New in Town that is under suspicion of being evil, and instead want to kill an {{Good|Gravedigger}}, or a {{Good|Bodyguard}}, then 'lying about who you were temporarily' can be very believable.

* If you are confident that the group believes you are the New in Town, then insist that the player who is the most dangerous to you be the one to nominate you! They will look evil when you don't die. For example, if an {{Good|Empath}} is giving the evil team a lot of trouble, you can insist that they nominate you, which will discredit them.

* Bluffing as the New in Town can be particularly potent if you are a Minion, since a good team who believes that either you or the person who nominated you is evil might spend two days executing both of you and not executing your Demon.

== Summary ==
"Each night, choose a player: they are poisoned tonight and tomorrow day."

The Poisoner secretly disrupts character abilities.
* Each night, the Poisoner chooses someone to poison for that night and the entire next day.
* A poisoned player has no ability, but the Storyteller pretends they do. They do not affect the game in any real way. However, to keep up the illusion that the poisoned player is not poisoned, the Storyteller wakes them at the appropriate time and goes through the motions as if they were not poisoned. If their ability gives them information, the Storyteller may give them false information.
* If a poisoned player uses a "once per game" ability while poisoned, they cannot use their ability again.
		</div>

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== How to Run ==
Each night, wake the Poisoner. They point at any player. The chosen player becomes poisoned—put the '''POISONED''' reminder token by the chosen player's character token. Put the Poisoner to sleep. (This poisoned player wakes and acts normally. They have no ability, but they think they do. If their ability would give them information, you can give false information to them if you wish. See “Village Idiotenness and Poisoning” in the rulebook.)

Each dusk, the poisoned player becomes healthy—remove their '''POISONED''' reminder.

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">

== Examples ==

			<div class='example'>
				During the night, the Poisoner poisons the {{Good|Hunter}}. The next day, the {{Good|Hunter}} tries to slay the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}. Nothing happens. The {{Good|Hunter}} now has no ability.
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				The poisoned {{Good|Empath}}, who neighbours two evil players, learns a "0.” The next night, the {{Good|Empath}}, no longer poisoned, learns the correct information: a "2.”
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				The {{Good|Investigator}} is poisoned. They learn that one of two players is the {{Evil|Baron}}, even though neither is a Minion. (Or even the right players, but the wrong Minion type.)
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				The {{Good|Gravedigger}} is poisoned. Even though the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} died today, they learn that the {{Good|New in Town}} died. A few days later, a poisoned {{Good|Saint}} dies, and the game continues.
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				The Poisoner poisons the {{Good|Mayor}}, then becomes the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}. The {{Good|Mayor}} is no longer poisoned because there is no Poisoner in play.

== Tips & Tricks ==

* Identifying targets for poison is vital. Characters who get information over several nights like the {{Good|Seer}} or {{Good|Gravedigger}} are great choices if you can find them. You can also make your choice based on the player; players who are strong leaders and rallying the good team or players who are quiet and trying not to attract attention are good options.

* Undermine players who trust each other by poisoning the characters getting key info in that clique. If a group is rallying around an {{Good|Gravedigger}}, you can turn the entire group on someone innocent by poisoning them at the right time.

* Co-ordinate with your Demon so that you are not selecting the same players - unless they are a character like the {{Good|Ravenkeeper}}, you'll just be wasting your poison for the day!

* Targeting characters like the {{Good|New in Town}}, {{Good|Hunter}} or {{Good|Mayor}} can be excellent, but only if they use their ability while they are poisoned. You'll need to convince them to use their ability, or time it right so that they are compromised at the moment they choose to activate.

* It's risky, but you can poison your own Demon, and use the lack of death for that night to bluff as the {{Good|Bodyguard}} or {{Good|Soldier}}. (You should probably warn your Demon you're going to do this!)

* If everyone is on board with the idea, try poisoning the {{Evil|Successor}}. If the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} chooses to kill themselves, the {{Evil|Successor}} will become the new Demon... unless you poison them first! That way, you or a third Minion can become the new {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} and keep the {{Evil|Successor}} in play. Just don't get your {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} killed while the {{Evil|Successor}} is still poisoned!

* You will usually be more efficient as a Poisoner by selecting multiple targets around the town rather than focusing on one player for the entire game. You only really need to poison the {{Good|Seer}} on the night they're checking your Demon, for example - then you're free to mess with other characters. This method of poisoning is also more difficult to detect than sticking to one player.

* On the other hand, if you only poison one player, that player might end up looking like the {{Good|Village Idiot}}, perhaps hiding the real {{Good|Village Idiot}}, or making it look like a {{Evil|Baron}} is in play.

* On the first night, if you don't know who to poison, poison a player sitting next to the Demon. You know which player is the Demon, and on the off chance that an {{Good|Empath}} is sitting next to the Demon, you'll be giving some very damaging information to the good team. 

* Make use of your {{Evil|Spy}}! They know who the best targets are and can guide you in the right direction.
		</div>

	</div>

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== Fighting the Poisoner ==

* The Poisoner is unlikely to target you because of your ability on the first night, since they don't know anyone but their fellow evil players and will be acting blindly. Therefore, you can usually trust that your ability will work correctly on the first night and day. This is particularly important for characters like the {{Good|New in Town}} and the {{Good|Hunter}}, who only get to use their abilities once, as well as the {{Good|Housekeeper}}, {{Good|Librarian}}, {{Good|Investigator}}, and {{Good|Chef}}.

* The Poisoner will especially want to target characters who get information over multiple nights, such as the {{Good|Empath}}, {{Good|Gravedigger}} or {{Good|Seer}}. They will also be keen to undermine characters like the {{Good|Hunter}}, who can kill their Demon. If you think a Poisoner is in play, be cautious about these characters and their information, especially if they have come out publicly. However, if you believe a player has been poisoned, you can usually assume they were given false information by the Storyteller.

* If you are a character that would be unaffected by poison (e.g. {{Good|Butler}}, {{Good|Chef}} who has gotten their info), you can try to bluff as a juicy target for the Poisoner, ensuring that they don't target anyone else.

* Separating the Poisoner from the {{Good|Village Idiot}} can be crucial. Knowing that you have one in play might signal what else is in the game. Uncovering a {{Good|Village Idiot}} might tell you that the {{Good|Recluse}} is telling you the truth, or that the {{Good|Butler}} might be lying. The {{Good|Librarian}} or {{Good|Investigator}}, {{Good|Gravedigger}}, and {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} can be the best ways to find out which is in play, but a lot of different people getting wrong information might point to the Poisoner.

* Be alert for characters who suddenly start getting inconsistent information, especially if they have recently revealed to the group. For example, an {{Good|Empath}} who is still sitting between the same neighbours but is suddenly getting a different number to the previous nights is likely poisoned.

* In the absence of more obvious targets, poisoners typically will end up targeting players that are: 
** Strong or outspoken, especially if they are rallying or leading the good team
** Friends or loved ones - it's hard to resist!
** Quiet, or are trying not to attract attention; these look like they have something to hide.

* Unlike other Minions, the Poisoner is deadly throughout the entire game so long as they are alive. If you have a lead on a suspected Poisoner, it is always to your benefit to take them out as early in the game as possible. For example, an {{Good|Investigator}} may know that one of two players is the Poisoner; it is best to execute them both. Alternatively, two players may be claiming to be the same character; this is usually an indication a Minion is doubling up with an existing good player, and eliminating both of them removes the Poisoner from contention.

* Remember that the Poisoner causes information to be misleading, not wrong. If you learn that you might have been poisoned, you might still have had true information!

== Summary ==
"Once per game, at night*, choose a dead player: if they are a Townsfolk, they are resurrected."

The Professor can bring someone back from the dead.
* Once per game, the Professor can choose a dead player. If that player is a Townsfolk, they are resurrected, becoming alive again.
* If the Professor chooses an Outsider, Minion, or Demon, then nothing happens, and the Professor’s ability is gone.
* The resurrected player regains their ability, even a “once per game” ability they used already.
* Resurrected Townsfolk may or may not get to act on the night of their resurrection, depending on whether they would act before or after the Professor. If they had a “first night only” or “you start knowing” ability, they immediately wake to use it again, as soon as the Professor goes to sleep.
		</div>

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== How to Run ==

Each night except the first, wake the Professor. The Professor either shakes their head no or points to a dead player. Put the Professor to sleep.

If the Professor chose a dead Townsfolk, the chosen player becomes '''alive''' again—mark them with the Professor’s '''ALIVE''' reminder and remove their shroud. (''They wake later tonight if they normally would. If they wake on the first night only, they wake now to use their ability.'') At dawn, after declaring which players died, declare which player is alive again. (''Do not say why.'') '''The Professor loses their ability'''—mark them with the '''NO ABILITY''' reminder and remove their night token from the night sheet.

			<div class='example'>
				The Professor resurrects the {{Good|Grandmother}}, who learns a good player’s character. At dawn, all players learn the {{Good|Grandmother}} player is alive, but not that the player is the {{Good|Grandmother}}.

			<div class='example'>
				The village idiot Professor chooses to resurrect the {{Good|Minstrel}}. Unbeknownst to the Professor, the {{Good|Minstrel}} was regurgitated by the {{Evil|Shabaloth}} and is now alive. The Storyteller shakes their head no, because the Professor must choose a dead player. The Professor chooses the dead {{Good|Fool}} instead. Nothing happens because the Professor is village idiot, and the Professor cannot use their ability again.

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== Tips & Tricks ==

* Use your ability as early as you possibly can! Evil players will ''really'' not want to keep you around, so getting your ability to trigger as soon as possible will give you an edge. Additionally, it is more likely that players who die early in the game will be good Townsfolk, since they are in the majority and evil will be protecting each other.
 
* Use your ability as late in the game as you dare! While risky, you can't underestimate how disruptive the resurrection of a confirmed Townsfolk at the end of the game can be for the evil team. The good team will be able to rally around both you and your revived Townsfolk, and the evil team will have a lot less options for disguising themselves as the game has worn on.

* Remember that if your ability fails, the dead player is either evil ''or'' an Outsider. Don't jump to conclusions ''right'' away - you could've targeted a confused {{Evil|Zombuul}} or  {{Good|Lunatic}}!

* Resurrect players who died at night, rather than players who were executed. It's not as sure a thing as in other editions, but players who die at night were ''probably'' targeted by the demon, and are therefore most likely good.

* Resurrect executed players if you believe the town has made a mistake! If your ability works, you have absolved an innocent townsfolk. If it doesn't, well, you can be very sure that they were right to execute them the first time. (Bonus strategy: Reveal yourself to a player you believe to be good, and ask them to be deliberately executed so you can bring them back, proving both of you. Especially effective early in the game!)

* Successfully resurrect a townsfolk, and you are going to be one of the more trustworthy good players in the game. While you won't be totally free of suspicion (the {{Evil|Shabaloth}} is always a concern), you and your revived Townsfolk will know you can trust each other 100%, and most other players will want to join your circle! Use this to your advantage to rally the good team in the face of evil.

* When picking who to resurrect, consider telling the player ahead of time what you intend to do. Not only does this lend credibility to the fact that you aren't the {{Evil|Shabaloth}} (since the Storyteller chooses who is regurgitated), but it also means the player can warn you off if they are an outsider who is bluffing as a townsfolk for whatever reason. Additionally, if the player agrees to go along with this plan and doesn't come back, you can be much more confident that they are evil, since they had the chance to stop you and didn't!
		</div>

	</div>

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== Bluffing as the Professor ==

When bluffing as the Professor, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* You can't resurrect anyone. Be prepared to explain why your ability failed. The Professor is often a more difficult bluff than other good characters in [[Bad Moon Rising]], so you will need to think ahead.

* Claim to have used your Professor ability on a player that the group considers to be suspicious. You can claim to have wanted to "test" to see if they were actually a Townsfolk or not. Choosing a suspicious player will more likely make you look like the good player, so is more useful if you are a Demon as opposed to a Minion.

* Claim to have used your ability on a trusted good player. When nothing happens, the group will assume (unless you can convince them that you were village idiot or poisoned for some reason) that one of you is evil. And the odds are, that if they are trusted, you are not. This strategy is more useful if you are a Minion, as being executed can often be a good thing.

* If the Demon is the {{Evil|Shabaloth}}, and a player is regurgitated at night, this can look identical to a Professor resurrecting someone. If you think this might happen, or if you have quick wits and can claim in the morning that last night's surprise living player was due to your efforts, you can convince the group that you have used your ability effectively. This is doubly damaging if the regurgitated player was actually a fellow Minion.

* If you are good player, bluffing as a Professor that has used their ability (and nothing happened) can be a great way to stay alive long enough to use your actual ability. Demons are usually not interested in attacking Professors that have lost their ability, since they are no longer a threat. For example, if you are the {{Good|Courtier}}, but want to ensure that you survive long enough to use your drunking ability, claiming to be a Professor that no longer has an ability will usually let you live long enough to do so.

== Tips & Tricks ==

* If the Demon knows you are the Ravenkeeper, they are very unlikely to kill you. It is to your benefit to bluff as a character who is a constant threat to the evil team, such as the {{Good|Empath}}, {{Good|Seer}}, {{Good|Hunter}}, or {{Good|Gravedigger}}. Even bluffing as a good character that tends to be trusted by the good team (such as {{Good|Chef}} or {{Good|Housekeeper}}) can make you look like a trusted good player in the eyes of the Demon, and attract their attention at night.

* The Ravenkeeper gets some of the best information in Trouble Brewing. Think about whose character you would like to learn before each night falls. You won't want to make a hasty decision and choose wildly in the moment.

* Choosing living players in usually more beneficial than choosing dead players. If you learn a living player is good, you know not to execute them. If you learn a living player is evil, you know you shouldn't trust them! However, every so often, confirming that a dead player is good can be an enormous help. For example, confirming that a dead {{Good|Housekeeper}}, {{Good|Librarian}}, {{Good|Investigator}} or {{Good|Chef}} is telling the truth can help you verify their information, or picking a dead player you have suspicions about can confirm that an evil player is dead. That might even back up the {{Good|Investigator}} or {{Good|Seer}}.

* Beware of the {{Evil|Spy}} and the {{Good|Recluse}}. If you believe a player is one of them, it is unlikely that you will learn their true character if you choose them, owing to their abilities to register as other characters. 

* If you learn a player is the {{Good|Village Idiot}}, then not only do you know that they are good, you can be reasonably certain that any information they gave to the group is wrong.

* Remember that you only get your information if you die at night. Getting killed during the day reveals nothing to you.

* Sometimes, sitting quietly and refusing to give any information can give you the air of a powerful threat without actually having to provide any justification for your bluff.

* You may want to tell the group that you are the Ravenkeeper first thing on the first day. This will almost guarantee that you are still alive on the final day, as the Demon will probably not kill you. This strategy means that you have more power in the late game (since living players may vote more than dead players), but you sacrifice the chance of gaining information by your death. Additionally, claiming Ravenkeeper is the sort of thing a {{Good|Hunter}} or {{Good|Gravedigger}} might do early game, so it might just get you killed.

* If you get to use your ability by dying at night, tell the group you are the Ravenkeeper the following day. Your information will be immediately useful. 

* If you see a good token, consider keeping that information private. If the Demon knows that you know that a player is good, that player becomes a much higher priority target, and you want the player you trust alive as long as possible.

* If you have told nobody that you are the Ravenkeeper, and you are still alive late in the game, then it is probable that a {{Evil|Spy}} is in play, telling the Demon who to attack. If you notice this happening, pay attention to who is whispering to whom.

== Bluffing as the Ravenkeeper==

When bluffing as the Ravenkeeper, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* The Ravenkeeper would wake only when they die during the night, not the day. They would wake up and choose a player, then be shown a character token.

* The Ravenkeeper is a fantastic bluff if you intend to pass the torch at some point to a Minion, or otherwise die protecting the Demon. Dying at night tends to make a player look good, and having information as a result of your death can allow you to throw blame, protect a fellow evil player, or make yourself look extremely trustworthy.
** Throwing blame allows you to point the finger at a good player as an evil one - casting doubt on them, their information, and who they trust.
** Alternatively you can back up the bluff of an evil player, confirming their identity and making them trustworthy for the good team. For example, if your Demon is claiming to be the {{Good|Bodyguard}}, you can claim to have chosen them and seen the {{Good|Bodyguard}} character token.
*** An advanced technique is to claim they are in fact a different character than the one they have been claiming publicly. Your fellow evil player can then reveal they were lying all along, and you are actually correct! (Make sure your teammate knows you're going to do this, or can otherwise adapt on the fly!)
** Finally, you can back up a good player's claim, which will get them to trust you and work with you. For example, if you know a player is the {{Good|Empath}}, claim you chose them and saw the {{Good|Empath}} token.

* Don't know the identity of the player you are confirming? Claim that person is the {{Good|Village Idiot}}. This will also cast doubt on their information, adding an extra layer of usefulness to the strategy.

* The Ravenkeeper is a fantastic bluff if you are trying to stay alive for the whole game. As the Demon will not want to kill a Ravenkeeper, you can claim that you are still alive in the late game because the Demon discovered your identity somehow (perhaps via the {{Evil|Spy}}, or just some good ol' fashioned eavesdropping).

* You only get information if you die, so be careful about who you choose to confirm. Dying as a Ravenkeeper usually takes some effort, and if you then appear to 'waste' that on a {{Good|Chef}} that nobody doubts, you will look suspicious.

* The Ravenkeeper is a great bluff to fall back on in the event that your bluff as a different character falls apart. Bluffs like the {{Good|Seer}}, {{Good|Gravedigger}} or {{Good|Empath}} can all run into trouble if you don't appear to have the right information, but if you reveal you were the Ravenkeeper all along, suddenly your duplicity will make sense.

* Some powerful characters will openly bluff as your character to protect themselves. Revealing yourself as the "real" Ravenkeeper and allowing them to keep the bluff can help you build trust with a good player while finding ways to undermine their ability.

== Summary ==
"You might register as evil & as a Minion or Demon, even if dead."

The Recluse might appear to be an evil character, but is actually good.
* Whenever the Recluse's alignment is detected, the Storyteller chooses whether the Recluse registers as good or evil.
* Whenever the Recluse is targeted by an ability that affects specific Minions or Demons, the Storyteller chooses whether the Recluse registers as that specific Minion or Demon.
* The Recluse may register as either good or evil, or as an Outsider, Minion, or Demon, at different parts of the same night. The Storyteller chooses whatever is most interesting.
* A Recluse that registers as a particular Minion or Demon does not have this character's ability. For example, a Recluse that registers as a Poisoner does not wake at night and cannot poison a player.
		</div>

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== How to Run ==
Each time the Recluse is targeted by an ability that detects or affects evil characters, choose which character and alignment the Recluse registers as. (Do whatever is appropriate, such as showing an evil character token, nodding, giving finger signals, or allowing an ability to work that would normally only affect evil, Minion, or Demon players.)

== Examples ==

			<div class='example'>
				The {{Good|Hunter}} uses their ability on the Recluse. The Storyteller decides that the Recluse registers as the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}, so the Recluse dies. The {{Good|Hunter}} believes that they just killed the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}. 
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				The {{Good|Empath}}, who neighbours the Recluse and the {{Good|Bodyguard}}, learns she is neighbouring one evil player. The next night, the {{Good|Empath}} learns they are neighbouring no evil players.
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				The {{Good|Investigator}} learns that either the Recluse or the {{Good|Saint}} is the {{Evil|Successor}}.
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				The Recluse is executed. The {{Good|Gravedigger}} learns that the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} was executed.
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				The Recluse neighbours the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} and an Evil Traveller. Because showing a "2" to the {{Good|Chef}} might be too revealing, the {{Good|Chef}} learns true information, a "0,” instead.

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== Tips & Tricks ==

* Tell everyone that you are the Recluse as soon as possible! This way, much of the good players' misinformation can be accounted for, such as that from the {{Good|Chef}}, {{Good|Empath}} or {{Good|Investigator}}. Characters that get further information, like the {{Good|Seer}} and {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} will know not to choose you. However, if the group knows that you are the Recluse, they may want to execute you anyway.

* Alternatively, stay silent about which character you are until the final day. If you can figure out which other players are Outsiders, or which characters you have been registering falsly to (hopefully not many), then you may be able to convince the group that you are actually an Outsider. Since the good team will often want to kill a Recluse, and this is not of benefit to the team as a whole, then staying alive by any means necessary is a helpful way to win.

* Remember that you are a good player, and are therefore generally a worse choice of execution than any evil player. You also might register as evil even after you're dead - the {{Good|Gravedigger}} will not get reliable information about you.

* You will usually register as evil - be suspicious of anyone saying otherwise. If you are sitting next to an {{Good|Empath}} who is saying that both their neighbours are good, or if a {{Good|Seer}} says you are not the Demon, they are probably lying, and therefore evil. Similarly, anyone who claims to have information about you being evil can often be trusted.

* Don't get Slayed! The {{Good|Hunter}} will usually kill you if they select you, and this will make it look like you are the Demon and a {{Evil|Successor}} is in play. This is not helpful to your team, and should be avoided at all costs. Similarly, avoid getting executed, since an {{Good|Gravedigger}} will usually learn that you are a Minion or Demon, confusing the good team even further.

* Registering as evil can sometimes be quite helpful. Players who say that you are evil can often be trusted, and information like the {{Good|Chef}} or {{Good|Empath}} can be downright useful in helping you detect other evil players... if you can convince the group that you are not actually evil.

* If the players are incredibly suspicious of you, and very much want to execute you, it is best to accept your fate before the final day happens. You can even vote for yourself to make sure you are executed. If the group thinks you are evil, then dying before the final day at least confirms that you are not the Demon, and will turn the good team's attention to other players. Dying on the second last day is safe. Dying on the last day means game over for you.

== Bluffing as the Recluse ==

When bluffing as the Recluse, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* You would never wake, learn anything, or act during the day.

* "I'm not evil, I just register that way" - Since the Recluse registers as evil, it's a great excuse for you to be registering as evil. This can help you avoid heat from characters like the {{Good|Empath}}. {{Good|Seer}} and even the {{Good|Investigator}}!

* Be as helpful to the good team as possible. Tell them early that you are the Recluse and be proactive about finding other Outsiders, making sure information isn't confused, etc. If they believe you are good, it'll be to their benefit to keep you alive, even if you appear to be messing up their abilities

* Use the Recluse as a backup bluff, or stay quiet about your claim for a while - you can eventually reveal and say you have been hiding to confuse evil players by hiding the existence of your Outsider status, or so that you can check the claims of players gathering information since you would register evil to them.

* As the Recluse continues to register as evil even when you are dead, you can maintain this bluff from beyond the grave, even when characters like the {{Good|Gravedigger}} or {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} have had a read on you. Insisting that there is still an alive Minion or Demon out there will help sow confusion into the town.

* Knowing that you register as evil will give the good team information to work with; be wary of characters like the {{Good|Chef}}, who will want to use you as a focal point for finding other evil players. If you're sitting right next to your Demon, maybe wait and see what people have to say before revealing your bluff.

* Claiming to be an Outsider can obscure the presence of a {{Good|Village Idiot}}, and perhaps imply the existence of a {{Evil|Baron}}.

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== Tips & Tricks ==

* Do not get executed.

* No, really. Don't. If you die by execution, the game ends, and your whole team loses. Make sure the good team knows you are the Saint! Tell it in the streets! Tell it from the rooftops! Tell it to everybody! You must be believed to be a good player, or it's curtains. If you have been nominated, cry black and blue that you are the Saint, loudly and publicly... the fate of the game depends on it.

* To help prove that you are good, you can arrange for other good players to confirm your identity. Kill players sitting between you and an {{Good|Empath}} so that the {{Good|Empath}} learns your alignment. Convince the {{Good|Seer}} to select you at night to prove you are not the Demon. Find a {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} and get them to agree to choose you so they learn who you are. Get a {{Good|Hunter}} to attempt to slay you. The Demon will usually not want to kill you at night, so the question of who you really are will be asked by the group at some stage, and having some players back you up could be crucial.

* Alternatively, either stay silent, or bluff as a juicy target for the Demon to attack, such as the {{Good|Hunter}} or the {{Good|Bodyguard}}. If you die at night, then you remove the possibility of being executed accidentally by the good team. It's only executions that count for your ability.

* Find out which other Outsiders are in play. If there are supposed to be two Outsiders in the game, and the only Outsiders to come out publicly are you and the {{Good|Recluse}}, for example, then even though you both look inherently suspicious, there are supposed to be two Outsiders in play, so the good team may believe that you are good for this reason alone. If you're the only one, so much the better! It must be you and a {{Good|Village Idiot}}.

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">

== Bluffing as the Saint ==

When bluffing as the Saint, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* You would never wake, learn anything, or act during the day, except on your execution, at which point the game is already over.

* Because of the Saint's lose condition, it is easily one of the best evil bluffs in the game. It is such a risk to execute you that the good team will usually err on the side of caution and leave you alone. This does not mean that it is bulletproof; on the final day, you're at the same risk as everyone else (since if they don't execute the Demon, they lose anyway). You'll also come under a reasonable amount of scrutiny as the game progresses.

* Saint is often an excellent bluff for the {{Evil|Poisoner}} in particular. Even if the good team truly believe you to be evil, perhaps with information from all three of the {{Good|Investigator}}, {{Good|Empath}}, and {{Good|Ravenkeeper}}, the good team may still be too scared to execute you before the final day, by when you've already done all the damage you need to. You can then either get executed and win for the evil team, or if you think the good team know you're not the Demon, have the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} attack themself in the night and make you the new Demon.

* If you are the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}, you know that your execution causes your team to lose if there's no {{Evil|Successor}} in the game. Because of that, if you're slated to be executed and try desperately to save yourself, the good team may correctly interpret that as a Demon trying to save themselves, at least long enough to kill themself and pass on the responsibilities to a Minion. That is severely limited by the Saint bluff, however - they may read that you want to avoid execution to stop your team from losing, but not know which team that is.

* Bluffing as the Saint in a game with no {{Evil|Baron}} can be tricky since you will likely be conflicting with other Outsiders. Fortunately, your lose condition makes you a larger threat to execute over a {{Good|Butler}} or {{Good|Recluse}}; use this to your advantage to leverage the execution of a good player.

* You may be detected as evil at some point during the game. A great counter-argument is that because you are the Saint, you are being targeted by the Storyteller. For example, you could say you are the {{Good|Seer}}'s false positive, or that an {{Good|Empath}} getting an evil read on you is actually {{Good|Village Idiot}}. 

* Good players benefit from bluffing as the Saint as well! Demons are unlikely to target a Saint since they would much rather they be executed. Using this to your advantage can allow you to survive a few days longer as an {{Good|Empath}} or {{Good|Seer}}.

* If you are executed, it will become immediately obvious you are not the Saint when the game doesn't end. Be prepared to have a back up bluff, such as the {{Good|Recluse}}, or a powerful Townsfolk who didn't want to die (like the {{Good|Gravedigger}} or {{Good|Hunter}}).

* Beware of {{Good|Hunter}}(s)! The Saint is usually a very powerful bluff to keep yourself safe from execution, but if a {{Good|Hunter}} is in play, they will very likely want to test you, and would not trigger the Saint's lose condition using their ability. One good way to circumvent this is to have a Minion bluff as the Saint, get slayed, and then have the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} pass the Demonhood to them after that.

* If you get nominated, drop any previous bluff and come out as the Saint. Claim that your previous information and character were a ploy to attempt to get the Demon to target you. This will usually give the good team significant pause.

* Don't be afraid to claim to be the Saint, even if there's already one in play. The good team can usually resolve cases of two players claiming to be the same character by executing them both in either order, but this is not possible to do with the Saint.

* Claiming to be an Outsider can obfuscate the presence of the {{Good|Village Idiot}}, or cause the good team to think that a {{Evil|Baron}} is in play.

== Tips & Tricks (if you are good) ==

* Stay alive, however you can. Lay low and don't tempt the Demon into attacking you. Avoid getting exiled until after your ability triggers. If you can live long enough for you to die in place of an executed player, that helps enormously. The Storyteller will often wait for the second half of the game for your ability to make your ability trigger, so be patient, and play it safe.

* When the Storyteller declares that the players kill you instead of the normal executee, this is great! Talk to the player you saved in private. You know that they are good, and they know that you are good. Work together, vote together, and win together. Encourage them to tell you any information that they have due to their character ability, and any information that they have due to other private conversations they have had. Do whatever you can to keep this player alive, and save your vote for when they vote too.

* Vote liberally, and try to convince others to do the same. If you execute an evil player, that's great! The Demon will often bluff as a powerful information-gathering character that the good team doesn't want to execute, so taking a chance on executing the {{Good|Seer}} might help your teammate enormoursly. If you execute a good player, you might be executed instead, which is what you want - you can keep that very real {{Good|Seer}} alive!

* After you have talked to the player whose life you saved, do whatever you can to convince the rest of the group that they are good. You have two publicly known facts to help you do this:
** Most Travellers are good. The odds that you are good, are good, therefore the odds that the player you saved is good, are good.
** Both you and the player you saved are the same alignment. If there is a {{Good|Chef}} or {{Good|Empath}} in play, their information would need to be congruent with you both being the same alignment. If an {{Good|Investigator}} or {{Good|Seer}} is in-play, their information may be incongruent with you both being evil. It is rare that a piece of information such as "two players are the same alignment" becomes publicly known, so use it to the full.

* Beware of the {{Evil|Spy}}! If they get the votes, you, the poor, innocent, good Scapegoat might be executed instead! You at least learn that they weren't the Demon when you were executed, so it's not all bad news!

* Feeling devious? Go up to a player you don't trust and tell them you're evil. Convince them to get themselves executed so you can 'prove' you're on the same team - only to watch them get executed for their crime of believing you. One Minion (or even Demon!) down.

* To help convince the group that you are good, make the argument that another Traveller in the game is evil. Whether they are actually good or evil doesn't really matter to you. What does matter is that if the group thinks that one of them is evil, they will believe that you are good, because the chance of there being 2 evil Travellers is small. A group that believes that you are the good Traveller will keep you alive long enough for you to use your ability, and will believe that the player whose life you save is good too. And you never know, maybe the Traveller that you are throwing under the bus actually is evil after all!

== Tips & Tricks (if you are evil) ==

* Stay alive, however you can. So that the Demon doesn't kill you, either talk to the Demon to let them know that you are evil, or otherwise get a message to them.  Avoid getting exiled no matter the cost. The Storyteller will almost always wait until the Demon is executed for your ability to trigger, so you remaining alive until that happens will save the evil team from defeat. Sometimes, the Storyteller will make your ability trigger when a Minion is executed instead. If this happens, that's still great, because at least that Minion gets another night and day in the game.

* You are that rare beast, an evil traveller who can prove themselves evil to their Demon! If they get the votes and you're executed instead, they know that you must be their ally!

* If the good team begins to think that you are evil, it may be best to die. Either get yourself exiled, or get the Demon to kill you. If you live, and your ability triggers when a Minion dies, the good team will believe that the Minion you saved is in fact evil. This may give them all the information they need to deduce who the Demon is. 

* When the Storyteller declares that the players kill you instead of the normal executee, this is great! Talk to the player you saved in private, just as if you were a good player. You can talk about the weather, football, whatever. As long as the good team believes that you are good, they will believe that the player you saved is good. If this player is the Demon, this strategy could win you the game. If this player is a Minion, they get to keep their ability and their daily voting power.

* If the game is near to a close, and you died in place of a Minion, it may be best if you look as evil as possible to the group. The following day, if just 3 or 4 players are left alive, the good team will probably execute the player you saved, believing them to be the Demon. If you look evil, the good team thinks that the Minion is evil, and may not click that they are not in fact the Demon. This strategy may still be useful if 5, 6, or even 7 players are still alive. Convincing the group to execute a Minion (again) at least means that they are not executing the Demon, and good loses precious time and votes in the process. 

* Do whatever you can to convince the rest of the group that the player whose life you saved is good. This may be an uphill struggle, depending on the number of other Travellers in play. Since the group will know for a fact that you are both the same alignment, they may be able to use this information to prove or disprove other player's alignments. Pay attention, and focus on discrediting key players. For example, if the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} just got executed but saved by you, and the {{Good|Empath}} is sitting next to you and knows that one of their neighbours is evil, you will need to completely discredit either the {{Good|Empath}}, or their other living neighbour... otherwise it's curtains for team evil.

== Summary ==
"Each night, choose 2 players: you learn if either is a Demon. There is a good player that registers as a Demon to you."

The Seer detects who the Demon is, but sometimes thinks good players are Demons.
* Each night, the Seer chooses two players and learns if at least one of them is a Demon. They do not learn which of them is a Demon, just that one of them is. If neither is the Demon, they learn this instead.
* Unfortunately, one player, called the Red Herring, will register as a Demon to the Seer if chosen. The Red Herring is the same player throughout the entire game. This player may be any good player, even the Seer themself, and the Seer does not know which player it is.
* The Seer may choose any two players—alive or dead, or even themself. If they choose a dead Demon, then the Seer still receives a nod.
		</div>

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== How to Run ==
While preparing the first night, put the Seer's '''RED HERRING''' reminder token by any good character token, marking that player as the Red Herring.

Each night, wake the Seer. The Seer points at any two players. If either chosen player is a Demon or the Red Herring, nod your head yes. Otherwise, shake your head no. Put the Seer to sleep.

In smaller games, making the Seer their own Red Herring is sometimes advised, as the Seer gets more information that way.

== Examples ==

			<div class='example'>
				The Seer chooses the {{Good|Bodyguard}} and the {{Good|Gravedigger}} and learns a 'no'.
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				The Seer chooses the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} and the {{Good|Empath}}, and learns a 'yes'.
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				The Seer chooses an alive {{Good|Butler}} and a dead {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}, and learns a 'yes'.

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== Tips & Tricks ==

* Getting a 'no' is often more useful than getting a 'yes'. A 'no' means that neither of the two players is the Demon, which narrows down the number of players you have to inspect. 

* You only learn about Demons. Just because you got a 'no' on somebody doesn't mean that they're good. They could still be a Minion.

* If you have a pair of players who you got a 'yes' on, and a pair of players you got a 'no' on, try picking one player from each pair. If you get another 'yes', you know that the player you got a 'yes' on both times is the player you're getting a read on; otherwise, it's the player in your initial 'yes' pair that you didn't pick this time that you should look to.

* If you have gotten a 'yes' on players you are suspicious of, getting confirmation of which player is causing your ability to react can give you a clear goal, especially if that player is still alive at the end of the game.

* You only have a limited number of nights to gather information. Spending a lot of it focusing on one or two people may give you less to work with in the end game. For this reason, it's usually most efficient to start the game casting a wide net and learn about as many pairs as possible. Then, after you have some general information, start focusing on the players you are most suspicious of.

* Remember that the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} can kill themselves and cause a Minion to become the Demon, and if they're executed, the {{Evil|Successor}} might become the Demon. Even if you got a 'no' on someone earlier in the game doesn't mean they aren't the Demon now. If you think the Demon died, try picking someone you think is a Minion that you previously got a 'no' on and see if your information has changed. 

* Your false positive is chosen at the beginning of the game and does not move, and you will not receive a false read from more than one player because of your ability. Remember your false register can be anyone, including you, and a 'yes' is not a definite confirmation of a Demon.

* You can choose yourself as one of the two players. Since you know you are not the Demon, this enables you to get a read on one specific player. Beware though, the Storyteller can make you your own false positive, so this may not always be effective.

* Be aware of the {{Good|Recluse}}, who may register as the Demon to you. This is not the same as the Red Herring.

* Claiming to be a character that the Demon would not want to kill, such as the {{Good|Saint}}, {{Good|Soldier}}, or {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} can help you survive longer, allowing you some much needed time to gain useful information.

== Bluffing as the Seer==

When bluffing as the Seer, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* You wake every night, including the first night, and should have information for each night you are alive. You would have pointed at two players and the Storyteller would have either nodded or shaken their head. When you reveal that you are the Seer, the good team will expect you to have a detailed explanation of every night's activities. Be prepared. Have what you are going to tell them ready. 

* You can lie that "these two players are not the Demon" to exonerate your fellow evil players. 

* The Seer can sometimes get wildly confusing information. The {{Good|Recluse}} may register as the Demon. The Demon itself can change players to someone who was previously a Minion, even if no {{Evil|Successor}} is in play. The 'Red Herring' can register as the Demon, making a good player look suspicious. Worry less about the exact content of your information, and the number of 'yes' results you claim to have received, and more about acting with conviction. 

* Having noted the above point, your bluff is still increased dramatically if the information you reveal to the group is consistent. If you tell players over and over again that certain players are not the Demon, they will tend to keep those players alive. If you tell players over and over again that certain players are possibly the Demon, they will tend to kill them, but may come for you next when the game doesn't end afterwards.

*If a good player is being particularly troublesome, focusing all your attention on them by claiming that they are registering as the Demon to you can quickly get them killed. You can always claim that they must have been your 'Red Herring' after the fact. This strategy can be particularly devastating if you need to get a player executed, but can not do so by normal means. In particular, you can get a {{Good|Saint}} executed or a {{Good|Mayor}} or {{Good|Soldier}} killed, or at least convince the good team not to trust them. Even sowing distrust about an {{Good|Gravedigger}}, {{Good|Empath}}, or similar character can be enough to make their information questionable.

* Remember that Seers may choose dead players, and may even choose themselves. Telling the group that a dead player is the Demon implies that all their information was dubious, and also (in single Minion games) that only one remaining player is evil. This misinformation, whilst seemingly innocent, can sway the game in your direction due to the extra mistrust among the living players. It is particularly effective if you make a {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} appear to be the Demon that killed themselves at night time.

* If you are the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}, you can come out publicly as the Seer and strategically die at night to make your information sound more legitimate.

* If you are the {{Evil|Successor}}, you can publicly accuse your actual Demon and lead the charge for their execution. This gives characters like the {{Good|Gravedigger}} a positive read of 'Demon', solidifying your bluff.

* If you know of a {{Good|Recluse}}, claim to have gotten a 'yes' on them. If you are or have spoken to a {{Evil|Spy}}, you can claim to have a 'yes' on the {{Good|Recluse}} before they can claim their character, which makes your 'yes' look even more believable.

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== Tips & Tricks ==

* If the Demon attacks you, nobody dies this night. This has two benefits. Firstly, since no good player has died at night, there are more players alive than there ought to have been, allowing the good team more time to execute. Secondly, no death of a night time supports your claim that you are indeed the Soldier.

* You will never know for sure that your ability has worked. If you wake up to no deaths, perhaps there is a {{Good|Bodyguard}} in play, or the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} decided to take a night off terrorising the living and attack someone's already dead corpse. Both of those look identical to the Demon attacking you in the night.

* Consider bluffing as a juicy Demon target, such as the {{Good|Seer}}, {{Good|Gravedigger}}, {{Good|Empath}} or {{Good|Hunter}}, to attract a Demon attack.

* If you can prove that you are the Soldier, then the good team has an enormous advantage on the final day. Instead of good choosing between three (or four) players to execute, they will be choosing between two (or three). Getting an  {{Good|Empath}} or {{Good|Seer}} to confirm you as not the Demon can be very helpful.

* A clever Demon will not attack you again after the first time unless they think they can kill you. If you can convince the Demon that a {{Good|Bodyguard}} protected you, the Demon might try to attack you again.

* If there are no deaths at night, don't immediately claim to be the Soldier! Perhaps the Demon attacked another player protected by the {{Good|Bodyguard}} and has no idea you were ever protected.

* If you are unsure whether they are good or evil, allow powerful information characters to bluff as your role. This way, the Demon is more likely to attack you, and less likely to attack them. You can even talk with these players secretly, and agree to publicly claim to be each others' characters - they stay safe, whilst you reveal their information to the group..

* If you die at night, you were either poisoned by the {{Evil|Poisoner}} , or you are the {{Good|Village Idiot}}. This is big information, and very helpful for the group to know. If you were poisoned, then a {{Evil|Poisoner}} is still alive (and in a one Minion game, you now know which Minion is in play!), which also gives you information about the alignment of the dead players. If you are the {{Good|Village Idiot}}, then nobody else can be the {{Good|Village Idiot}}. Either way, you learn something useful.

* Tell the group you are the Soldier at some stage during the game. After all, good will need as much information as they can get at their disposal.

* If you have told nobody that you are the Soldier, you are still alive on the final day, and a death has occurred every night so far, then it is probable that a {{Evil|Spy}} is in play and telling the Demon who to attack. If you notice this happening, pay attention to who is whispering to who.

* If you never tell anyone who you are, your role can combo in a very risky way with the {{Good|Mayor}}. You might be more confident to execute nobody in final three than anyone else in your position. Even if the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} is pretending to be the {{Good|Mayor}}, and you execute no one, evil hasn't won yet! The Demon still has to kill either you or the other surviving player, and just maybe they'll guess wrong, and you will wake to a second day with just three players alive.

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== Bluffing as the Soldier ==

When bluffing as the Soldier, there's a few things you should keep in mind:

* The Soldier never wakes, and never acts during the day. You would receive no indication that you were ever attacked. You have no information at all to keep track of.

* The Soldier is an easy bluff, as you don't give any information and your alleged ability explains your longevity as the game goes on. This does not mean you should rest on your laurels though; ''because'' you have no information, people may eventually become suspicious of you as the options narrow. A Soldier who is trying to help good (by bluffing as a juicy target like the {{Good|Seer}} for the Demon to kill, for example) can carry more favor than a Soldier sitting quietly.

* Staying quiet and trying not to draw attention to yourself is the mark of a powerful character... or a Soldier trying to draw the attention of a Demon. Sitting quietly and acting cagey about your ability for a few days makes it look like you are genuinely trying to get targeted.

* You (or your Demon) can choose to kill an already dead player at night. This will give the illusion that no death actually occurred, allowing you to claim that you were targeted instead.

* Because it cannot die at night, information characters often can and will bluff as the Soldier. You can gain the trust of a player doing this by "revealing" yourself as the true Soldier, and offering to swap characters with them in order to keep them alive longer while making yourself more of a target. (Bonus: If you have a {{Evil|Poisoner}} in play, keep this player alive while completely undermining their ability!) 

* The Soldier cannot die at night (unless poisoned or actually the {{Good|Village Idiot}}). If you die, you'd best have a good explanation ready for why that happened!

"Each night, you see the Grimoire. You might register as good & as a Townsfolk or Outsider, even if dead."

The Spy might appear to be a good character, but is actually evil. They also see the Grimoire, so they know the characters (and status) of all players.
* If any character has an ability that would detect or affect a good player, then the Spy might register as good to that character. If any character has an ability that detects Townsfolk or Outsiders, then the Spy might register as a specific Townsfolk or Outsider to that player. It is the Storyteller's choice as to what the Spy registers as, even as many characters or both alignments during the same night.
* A Spy that registers as a particular Townsfolk or Outsider does not have this character's ability. For example, a Spy that registers as a Hunter cannot slay the Demon.

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== How to Run ==
Each night, wake the Spy and show them the Grimoire for as long as they need. Put the Spy to sleep.

Each time the Spy is targeted by an ability that detects or affects good characters, choose what character and alignment the Spy registers as. (Do whatever is appropriate, such as showing a good character token, nodding, giving finger signals, or allowing an ability to work that would normally only affect good, Townsfolk, or Outsider players.)

Remember to keep your Grimoire tidy and show it to the Spy in the correct orientation, so the Spy can easily see who is who.

== Tips & Tricks ==

* If you're reading this having just pulled the Spy token this tip won't help you, but if you're about to play your first game, ask your Storyteller to show you an example of a grimoire, so you're prepared when they wake you up.

* Providing your memory is good, you start the game knowing everything! All characters in play and who they are will be laid out in the Grimoire. Use this information to help the evil team pick good bluffs and take out high priority targets.

* It isn't necessary to memorise everything. Some important things to remember can be:
** A character that isn't in play, for you to bluff (perhaps more than one, in case you get chance to talk to a fellow minion), and any information you might need to support your bluff.
** Some people the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} should kill or your {{Evil|Poisoner}} poison, like the {{Good|Hunter}} or {{Good|Gravedigger}}
** Some people the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} should definitely not kill, like the {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} or {{Good|Soldier}}
** Any reminder tokens you think will be important

* Take your time! The Storyteller will show you the Grimoire for as long as you need.

* In the Grimoire, you will not only see who everyone is, but the Storyteller reminder tokens. These will allow you to identify who is a {{Good|Village Idiot}}, who your {{Evil|Poisoner}} targeted, who the {{Good|Seer}} red herring is, who the Demon killed,  who the {{Good|Housekeeper}}/{{Good|Librarian}} is getting their read on, and the alignment of any Travellers. Remember that you may register as good for a  {{Good|Housekeeper}} or {{Good|Librarian}}; if you see this in the Grimoire, you can lean into that bluff early on.

* Choosing a good bluff for yourself is easy, because you know all characters that are not in play.

* You also have access to information that is hard to guess or obtain as an evil player, like player's characters. This makes you an especially potent {{Good|Housekeeper}}, {{Good|Gravedigger}} or {{Good|Ravenkeeper}}, since all of these characters learn that sort of information. You can gain the trust of good players by being able to name their character, especially if they haven't revealed yet, or if they are bluffing as something else.

* Bluffing as the {{Good|Librarian}} or the {{Good|Investigator}} and selecting powerful characters (like the {{Good|Empath}}, {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} or {{Good|Mayor}}) to mark as the {{Good|Village Idiot}} or as an evil Minion will let you undermine these players. As the Spy, you can do this before they come out, which lends credibility to your claim compared to other evil players doing the same type of bluff.

* You can provide support to your Demon and other Minions (like the {{Evil|Poisoner}}) by secretly giving them powerful characters to target early on, neutralizing them before they pose a serious threat for the evil team. In general, you are going to want to have a lot of secret conversations with fellow evil players to communicate the information that you have; prepare a solid alibi to explain why you were whispering.

* You will usually register as a good player to characters like the {{Good|Empath}}, {{Good|Chef}}, and {{Good|Gravedigger}}. Thanks to this, you will be able to gain the trust of good players much more easily than the other evil characters. This also makes you a great candidate to become the Demon in the later game. Encourage the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} to pass on their Demonhood to you once you are well established!

* You are the only evil player that can activate the {{Good|New in Town}} ability. Players who die this way are usually the most trusted characters in the game. Deliberately giving false information and then sacrificing yourself on a {{Good|New in Town}} can give you a platform to confuse and mislead the good team. Similarly if you know an {{Good|Gravedigger}} is in play, you can allow yourself to be executed, so when you register as good to them, they will trust you and your information. This can also be a great way to undermine an undesirable execution (for example, your Demon) - you will die and your execution will take priority over the existing vote.

* The Spy is particularly effective for bluffs that require more than one player. For example, you can claim to be the {{Good|Housekeeper}}, {{Good|Librarian}} or {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} and back up your Demon's character claim. (You should probably let your Demon know you're going to do this!)

* You will often register as good, which is great if you are sitting near an {{Good|Empath}}, or if a {{Good|Chef}} is in play. This will help you with your goal of infiltrating the good team and getting them to trust you.

* You can telegraph possible bluffs to other evil players, without needing to have a private conversation with them. Like talking about "stars" or "jewels" in order to let a partner know that you are strong in diamonds in a game of bridge, you can use subtleties of language to hint to your allies what characters they can bluff as. Or, sometimes, just tell them directly. For example, if you publicly say, "I won't say who, but somebody told me that David is the {{Good|Bodyguard}}", then David might realise what you are doing, and start bluffing as the {{Good|Bodyguard}}.

* Make sure the Storyteller knows what you are claiming to be - this will enable them to back up your bluff to other players. For example, if you are bluffing as the {{Good|Butler}} and you are executed, the Storyteller will know to show the {{Good|Gravedigger}} the {{Good|Butler}} token.

* You won't always register as good. Sometimes the town will see you as evil - and that's okay! The last thing you want is for your Demon to be executed because you're too well trusted.

== Fighting the Spy ==

* Detecting the Spy is the first step in fighting the Spy. For example, the Demon kills may be a little bit too efficient. If your {{Good|Seer}} and {{Good|Hunter}} swiftly drop dead while your {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} and {{Good|Soldier}} are unscathed, that is a sign that the Demon knows more than they should.

* If you suspect a Spy, you should assume that the evil team knows everything, which means it is now in the good team's best interest to share everything they have. This will allow you to coordinate more efficiently, while also catching out evil players who didn't have their bluff totally prepared.

* Pay attention to players who spend a lot of time whispering together, particularly on the first day; while this is not always a Spy and their Demon, they often have more to talk about than the average pair of players.

* If you are a {{Good|New in Town}}, {{Good|Gravedigger}} or {{Good|Ravenkeeper}}, be wary of players who seem too eager to die and prove who they are. Because the Spy can register as good, this might be their attempt to weasel their way into your good graces.

* The Spy is particularly good at bluffing as characters like the {{Good|Housekeeper}} or the {{Good|Ravenkeeper}}, as these characters detect information that is not usually available to the evil team until those players come out. If you suspect a Spy, keep a close eye on anyone claiming to be these roles.

* Characters who detect alignment, like the {{Good|Empath}} or the {{Good|Chef}} may get information that doesn't seem to add up. This can sometimes be an indication that the Spy is causing the numbers to be off by registering as good.

* The Spy will know if they've been seen by the {{Good|Housekeeper}} or {{Good|Librarian}} as a good player, but they won't know the character. If one of these characters claims to have seen a character that neither of the people they saw are claiming to be, perhaps a Spy misregistered to them. This can be particularly significant if the {{Good|Librarian}} saw an Outsider and one of the people they saw is claiming to be a different Outsider - perhaps the Spy took a one-in-four chance, and guessed wrong.

* An {{Good|Gravedigger}} or {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} can learn that a player is in fact the Spy. This is usually a lie by the Storyteller and should regarded with suspicion.

* The {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} is more likely to kill themselves and pass their Demonhood on if a Spy is in play due to the Spy's ability to integrate themselves into the town. Be wary of any deaths at night that do not make sense.

== Summary ==
"If there are 5 or more players alive & the Demon dies, you become the Demon. (Travellers don't count.)"

The Successor becomes the Demon when the Demon dies.
* If there are five or more players just before the Demon dies—that is, four or more players left alive after the Demon dies—then the Successor immediately becomes the Demon, and the game continues as if nothing happened.
* Travellers do not count as players when seeing if the Successor's ability triggers.
* If less than five players are alive when the Demon is executed, then the game ends and good wins.
* If five or more players are alive when the Imp kills themself at night, the Successor must become the new Imp.
* If the Successor becomes the Demon, they are that Demon in every way. Good wins if they are executed. They attack each night. They register as the Demon.
		</div>

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">

== How to Run ==
If the Demon dies and there were five or more alive players immediately before the Demon died, replace the Successor token with a spare Imp token, changing that player's character from the Successor into the Imp. (They are now the Demon and have the Imp's ability. If they die, good wins.)

That night, wake the new Imp, show them the '''YOU ARE''' info token, then show them the Imp token.

In Trouble Brewing, there is only one Demon—the Imp. In other editions, there are multiple possible Demons. If the Successor becomes the Demon, they become the same type of Demon that died, and they gain this Demon's ability. When this happens, mark the Successor with the '''IS THE DEMON''' reminder and refer to that Demon's "How to Run" instructions.

== Examples ==

			<div class='example'>
				There are seven players alive: the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}, the Successor, two Townsfolk, and three Travellers. The {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} is executed, so the game ends and good wins because Travellers do not add to the player count for the Successor's ability.
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				There are five players alive: the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}, the Successor, the {{Evil|Baron}}, and two Townsfolk. The {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} is executed. The Successor becomes the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}, and the game continues.
			</div>

			<div class='example'>
				Brianna is the Successor. The {{Good|Seer}} chooses Brianna and Alex, and learns a "no.” Later, the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} dies, so Brianna becomes the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}. The {{Good|Seer}} chooses Brianna and Alex again, and learns a "yes."

== Tips & Tricks ==

* The Successor is at her strongest when you co-ordinate with the Demon and figure out a strategy that you both like, since the Demon can safely die. Maybe you accuse the Demon of being evil, and the Demon does everything possible to make the good team think they are indeed evil? This makes you look very good, and trustworthy. Maybe the Demon kills themselves of a night time and claims to be the {{Good|Ravenkeeper}}, saying that you are the character you say you are. Maybe the Demon accuses you of being evil, but does so unconvincingly, so that you look good by comparison. Maybe you and the Demon both claim to be the same character, such as the {{Good|Mayor}}? After all, "one of you must be the {{Good|Mayor}}", right? It doesn't matter which one of you dies, since the game continues with a living Demon either way.

* In the early game, staying alive is more important for you compared to other Minions. Whist it doesn't really matter if the {{Evil|Baron}}, or {{Evil|Poisoner}} dies early (since they can often cause a lot of disruption early in the game), you will need to survive until the end of the game if you intend to become the Demon at some point. Waiting, listening, then claiming to be a character that you know is not in play often achieves this best.

* Timing is important. Remember that if fewer than five players are alive when the Demon dies, the game is over and good wins. If your Demon has a lot of heat on them, and you think that they won't survive to the final day, take action and get your Demon killed while five or more players are still alive... before it's too late.

* Whilst you are the Successor, you will not register as the Demon. So, if you can get yourself confirmed as such by good characters, such as the {{Good|Hunter}} or the {{Good|Seer}}, then become the Demon at a later stage, then the good team will be very confused about the identity of the real Demon, as their information won't add up.

* If the Demon is playing well, and seems to be trusted by the good team, there is no need to use your ability. You can play the normal Minion role of spreading false information, breeding distrust among the good players and generally being troublesome whilst ignoring your character ability.
		</div>

	</div>

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== Fighting the Successor ==

* When the Successor is in play, the Demon can get away with doing certain things they would not be able to otherwise. For example, they can be successfully executed, or die by a {{Good|Hunter}}'s ability and the game will continue. If you are certain that you definitely took out the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} but the game is still going, you should be suspicious that a Successor is in play. It is possible for an {{Good|Gravedigger}} to correctly see the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} token without being the {{Good|Village Idiot}}!

* If the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} kills themselves at night, the Demonhood must always pass to the Successor first before any other Minions. This can allow you to narrow down where the new Demon has ended up if the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}} gets away from you.

* The Demon and the Successor may co-ordinate on their bluffs to confirm each other. For example, the Successor may claim to be the {{Good|Housekeeper}} and "confirm" the Demon's claim. This has the benefit of making them both look good, and potentially set up passing on the Demonhood later in the game.

* The Successor does not register as a Demon, which means characters who detect Demons specifically will appear to get a clean read on them. For example, the {{Good|Seer}} will not detect them, and the {{Good|Hunter}} ability will not work on them. Be wary of players who are overeager to be checked or confirmed, especially early in the game.

* If you know a Successor is in play (e.g. Getting a read from an {{Good|Investigator}} or a {{Good|Ravenkeeper}}), then a good strategy can be to leave them alive. On the final days when three players are left alive, you no longer have to answer the question "who is the Demon", but "did the Demon pass to the Successor". If you think they did, you execute the Successor. If you don't think they did, you eliminate the Successor from contention and now have a one in two shot at the Demon overall.

* Unlike other Minions, the Successor can be bolder about targeting their own Demon, and may even deliberately try to get them killed to make themselves look better. If you suspect someone is a Successor, pay close attention to who they are targeting, and if their allegiances abruptly change; if they have been targeting a particular player and then change their tune once it gets below five players, then that may very well be their Demon.

* The Successor is usually a backup plan, not a phase two; if the Demon is well integrated into the town or not under much suspicion, the Successor may end up behaving more like a regular Minion, and sacrifice themselves more freely. If you discover a Successor throwing themselves on their sword, it can be worthwhile to be suspicious of players who have been considered trustworthy up until that point.

== Summary ==
"Each night, choose a player (not yourself): their vote counts negatively tomorrow."

The Thief steals votes from a player, making their vote count negatively.
* When a player chosen by the Thief votes, the vote tally goes down by one instead of up by one. This happens every time that player votes that day.
* The player with the negative vote changes back to having a positive vote immediately if the Thief dies, including if the Thief is exiled, because the Thief loses their ability.
* Exiles are never affected by abilities, so the player with the negative vote can support exiles unaffected by the Thief’s ability.
* Since the Storyteller counts the number of votes out loud as they move their hand around the circle, all players will know which player the Thief chose.

		<div class="small-12 large-6 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">
== How to Run ==

Each night, wake the Thief. They point at any player. Mark the chosen player with the Thief’s '''NEGATIVE VOTE''' reminder. Put the Thief to sleep.

Each time you tally the vote of a player marked '''NEGATIVE VOTE''', count it as subtracting one vote instead of adding one vote. (''Count this out loud, as normal.'')

			<div class='example'>
				The Thief chooses Abdallah. Abdallah votes for an execution, and instead of the tally being six, it is four. Since 10 players are alive, the nominee is not executed today. Later that day, the players are voting to exile the {{Traveler|Gunslinger}}. Abdallah votes to exile, and his vote counts as positive.

== Tips & Tricks (if you are good) ==

* Use your ability to undermine players who you believe are evil! Secretly pick a player you suspect at night, and do not let them know tomorrow that their vote is now negative. When this player votes, they'll be voting with the expectation that they'll be counting towards the vote, when in fact they'll be undermining whatever cause they're working for. This is especially potent later in the game, when the evil team will be more aggressively voting to get good players killed and defend their own.

* Weaponize your negativity - pick a player you believe to be good, and tell them about it! While this does mean one less good vote on the table, this player now has the very powerful ability to vote ''against'' a nomination. If you both believe the evil team is making a push, you can immediately counter them by throwing this unexpected negative vote into the mix.

* Swap up who you are picking, especially if you're trying to pick evil players. Once a player knows their vote counts negatively, they can use it to their advantage. To avoid this, change who you pick each night, moving the negative vote around and keeping players guessing where the negative vote is hiding now. Keeping up this strategy can be beneficial even if you are primarily picking good players, since the evil team could kill a repeat player to stop them abusing your ability. Additionally, you will gain interesting information about every player you pick, so selecting as many unknowns as you can and trying to read their reaction can be very helpful!

* Double and triple bluff who you picked publicly. Players who believe their vote counts negatively will react differently to players who think their vote is normal. With the power of words alone, you can be able to convince an evil player not to vote at a critical juncture, believing that they'll hurt their team if they do. Meanwhile, the vote is ''actually'' with a good player you trust. Combining this with a switching strategy will prevent anyone weaponizing your ability unless you actually want them to.

* Remember that you can pick dead players if you want to. This is particularly useful on the final day, since that is when most dead players will be using their single vote. If a dead player asks you to pick them before the final day, this may be a useful option too. A dead {{Good|New in Town}} that you know is good and will use a single negative vote wisely, is often  better choice than a living player that intends to use their negative vote willy-nilly.

* Keep quiet about who you pick so nobody knows what to expect! This will often mean that players you want to execute, don't get executed, which is an unfortunate downside. However, when each player first votes each day, you can observe their reaction and body language. If they seem pleased that a vote was negative, they are more likely to be an evil player, since they now have the power to prevent the Demon from being executed today.

* If a {{Traveler|Bureaucrat}} is in play, and you think that they are good, co-ordinate with them and both choose the same player, giving a whopping 3 negative votes to a player of your choice. Even if you think the {{Traveler|Bureaucrat}} might be evil, you may be able to convince them to play along with the triple-negative vote strategy, for fear of being Exiled if they don't.
		</div>

	</div>

	<div class='row'>

		<div class="small-12 large-12 columns" style="padding-right: 0;">

== Tips & Tricks (if you are evil) ==

* Pick good players who are figuring out who is good and who is evil, but don't tell them that you have stolen their vote. They will vote for executions that they want to pass, and this will often mean that they are voting for good players. Avoid choosing good players that are completely clueless as to who is evil, as their negative vote may have the opposite effect to what you want. In the situation where a good player has a negative vote, you may want to nominate suspicious-looking evil players earlier rather than later each day, because the good player with the negative vote will realize afterwards that they can deliberately make an execution fail. 

* Lie about who you chose. This will cause confusion and trick the good players into making executions fail when they don't want them to. If a player believes that they have a negative vote, they will vote when they want an execution to fail, but accidentally increase its chances of succeeding instead.

* Pick evil players, and tell them that you have picked them. Evil players know exactly who is good and who is evil, so will always use their negative vote effectively. You may need to swap between evil players - choosing the Demon one night, then choosing a Minion the next night.

* On the final day, you definitely want to choose an evil player, and have them know that you have chosen them. Even if the good team exiles you after the fact, having a negative vote on the Demon is incredibly helpful. It may even win you the game!

== Summary ==
"You do not know you are the Village Idiot. You think you are a Townsfolk character, but you are not."

The Village Idiot player thinks that they are a Townsfolk, and has no idea that they are actually the Village Idiot.
* During setup, the Village Idiot's token does not go in the bag. Instead, a Townsfolk character token goes in the bag, and the player who draws that token is secretly the Village Idiot for the whole game. The Storyteller knows. The player does not.
* The Village Idiot has no ability. Whenever their Townsfolk ability would affect the game in some way, it doesn't. However, the Storyteller pretends that the player is the Townsfolk they think they are. If that character would wake at night, the Village Idiot wakes to act as if they are that Townsfolk. If that Townsfolk would gain information, the Storyteller may give them false information instead—and the Storyteller is encouraged to do so.

== How to Run ==
While setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag, remove the Village Idiot token and add a Townsfolk character token. Add the Village Idiot's '''IS THE VILLAGE IDIOT''' reminder token to the Grimoire. Put the swapped Townsfolk character token in the bag, not the Village Idiot character token.

While preparing the first night, put the Village Idiot's '''IS THE VILLAGE IDIOT''' reminder token by any Townsfolk character token, changing that player's character to the Village Idiot. They are now an Outsider, and do not have the ability of this Townsfolk character. (But they think they do.)

During the game, act as if the Village Idiot is actually this Townsfolk character. (If that character would wake to act at night, the Village Idiot wakes to act. If their ability would give them information, you can give false information to them if you wish. See "Village Idiotenness and Poisoning" in the rulebook.)

== Tips & Tricks ==

* The Village Idiot will never know that they are the Village Idiot - they will start the game with a Townsfolk token and behave as that Townsfolk normally while receiving bad information. Figuring out if you are the Village Idiot can only be discovered via gameplay; be looking for tells like information you receive being demonstrably false, or your ability failing (e.g. A {{Good|Soldier}} dying at night).

* Figuring out if a Village Idiot is in play is important - this will allow Townsfolk to know whether or not they should be scrutinizing their information. The most obvious tell that a Village Idiot may be in the town is if there are more or fewer Outsiders than you expected (if more, there might be a {{Evil|Baron}} who has let a Village Idiot into town). 

* If you suspect a Village Idiot is in play, it is important to determine which of the Townsfolk it is as soon as possible. There can only be one Village Idiot in play, so knowing who it is will allow you to treat their information skeptically, but it will also mean that all other Townsfolk can probably trust what they know to be true and reliable.

* Differentiating the effects of a Village Idiot from a {{Evil|Poisoner}} can be difficult, but crucial. If only one person seems to be receiving false information, they might be the Village Idiot. If multiple people are receiving sporadically good and bad information, that's probably the work of a dastardly {{Evil|Poisoner}}. Try to extrapolate from the case where either one is true, and see what inferences you can draw from that. Perhaps a Village Idiot being in play means that the {{Good|Butler}} is lying? Or if there's a {{Evil|Poisoner}} in a game with only one Minion, you know that nobody who's been executed could have been the {{Evil|Alpha Wolf}}.

* Characters like the {{Good|Gravedigger}} and {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} will see the Village Idiot character when checking that player. You do not register as a Townsfolk - you just think you are! This is also true for characters like the {{Good|New in Town}} - a Village Idiot cannot activate them because they are not really a Townsfolk, they're an Outsider.

* If you have figured out you are the Village Idiot, try to reverse engineer what you know. For example, if you thought you were the {{Good|Empath}} and have been getting a read of '0', you should be suspicious that you have at least one evil neighbour after all. Or, if you thought you were an {{Good|Investigator}}, you can probably assume that neither of the two players you saw were Minions!

* Remember that the Village Idiot receives ''unreliable'' information, not false information. In the majority of cases, the information you receive will be wrong, but sometimes the Storyteller may tell you something that is true. This can happen when the alternative would definitely reveal you are the Village Idiot (e.g. The Village Idiot {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} choosing themselves will be shown the {{Good|Ravenkeeper}}).

* Keep in mind that characters like the {{Good|Hunter}}, {{Good|Bodyguard}} and {{Good|Mayor}} cannot impact the game with their ability when they are actually the Village Idiot. For example, a {{Good|Hunter}} will not kill a good player instead of the Demon; their shot will always fail.

== Bluffing as the Village Idiot ==

When bluffing as the Village Idiot, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* You would not know that you are the Village Idiot at first. You would receive a Townsfolk character. The Storyteller would treat you as if you were that Townsfolk; check the relevant 'bluffing as' section to see how that character would wake (or not!)

* The Village Idiot is the only good character that you can claim to be without another good character calling you out for claiming the same character as them.

* Bluff as a character that gains information more passively, such as the {{Good|Seer}}, {{Good|Investigator}}, {{Good|Empath}}, {{Good|Housekeeper}}, {{Good|Gravedigger}} or {{Good|Librarian}} and give deliberately and obviously false information. If your information is ridiculous (like claiming one of two players is the {{Good|Saint}} whilst neither is claiming to be the {{Good|Saint}}), you look obviously the Village Idiot.

* Bluff as a character that has a power that can fail, then when your fake ability fails, act surprised, and put forward the possibility that you are the Village Idiot. For example, bluff as the {{Good|Bodyguard}}, and claim the player you protected died anyway. Bluff as the {{Good|Soldier}} and kill yourself of a night time, or get the Demon to kill you. Bluff as the {{Good|Hunter}} or nominate the {{Good|New in Town}}, and act surprised when these character abilities have no visible effect.

* Insinuate a Village Idiot is in play, and lead the group on a hunt to find out who it is. This will distract them from the main goal of finding the Demon, and will make them distrust their own good team.

* Insinuate that a particular player is village idiot. This is especially helpful if they have a damning case against your team, such as a {{Good|Gravedigger}} claiming that your dead {{Evil|Poisoner}} is indeed the dead {{Evil|Poisoner}}.

* Convincing the group that a Village Idiot is in play, or that a particular player is the Village Idiot, is MUCH easier to achieve if the number of people publicly claiming to be Outsiders supports your story. For example, if you are saying that the {{Good|New in Town}} is village idiot, and there is supposed to be just the one Outsider in play, but the real {{Good|Saint}} has revealed who they are, then the only way for the {{Good|New in Town}} to be the Village Idiot is if the {{Good|Saint}} is lying. If you bluff as an Outsider, or if a fellow evil player bluffs as an Outsider, then it is much easier to convince the good team that a Village Idiot is in play, because the extra Outsiders make it look like a {{Evil|Baron}} is in the game, which would add two extra Outsiders.

* If you want a fellow evil player to back up your bluff as the Village Idiot, get them to claim to be the {{Good|Librarian}}. The {{Good|Ravenkeeper}} and {{Good|Gravedigger}} work well too, but one of you will have to die for that to work.

* If you intend to bluff as the Village Idiot later in the game, and you believe you can succeed, initially give opposite information to what you want the good team to believe. If you are claiming to be the {{Good|Empath}} for example, and later in the game you want to execute your good neighbours, then initially tell the group that both your neighbours are good - if later on, the group comes to believe that you are the Village Idiot, then they will assume that at least one of your neighbours is evil and execute them both.
