You are emboldened to do whatever you want, since you have nothing to lose!",
  
  "Since you add Outsiders to the game, and those players will almost always publicly claim to be Outsiders, claiming to be an Outsider as well causes havoc. If a Village Idiot is in play, only you and a real Outsider have claimed to be Outsiders - in this situation, the good team will know that a Baron is in play, but will think that you are actually an Outsider, since there appear to be 2 more Outsiders than usual. If, however, there is no Village Idiot in play, then there will appear to be three more Outsiders than usual in the game, and the good team will probably want to execute all three Outsiders, since they know that at least one is evil - and being responsible for the executions of three players (including yourself) is a great way to start any game and give your team the advantage.",
  
  "Deliberately double up with an in-play character that you want to undermine. Since it does not matter if you die, claiming to be a Fortune Teller or a Gravedigger or even a Mayor when that character is already is in play, causes the good team to look upon you both with suspicion. They may think you are evil, but they will usually be suspicious of the other player as well, and not trust any information they give.",
  
  "Claiming that a Baron is in play when there is no Baron in play is a great strategy for the evil team. Claiming to be an Outsider means that the group conversation will turn to figuring out whether or not a Baron is in play. If the good team comes to believe a Baron is indeed in play, then you look like a legitimate Outsider, but the good team will also come to believe that a Village Idiot is in play, because the Village Idiot must be the other Outsider. They will not trust their own information.",
  
  "Better yet, if you claim that a Baron is in play when there isn't, and two evil players both claim to be Outsiders, then it will seem like they are the two Outsiders added by the Baron, and will usually not be executed by the good team. Since good wants to keep good players alive, even good players that are \"confirmed\" as Outsiders are better off alive than dead.",
  
  "Throw suspicion onto the Outsiders. If you can make the good team think that the Outsiders you added are evil, they will chase their tails looking for signs of a Poisoner or Successor!",
  
  "Be a patsy. If you are executed, the Alpha Wolf is not. Don't be afraid to die this way, since it gives the Alpha Wolf a day of safety. Furthermore, if you can look so execution-worthy that characters like the Hunter or Ravenkeeper use their ability on you, then at least they are not using it on the Alpha Wolf. Even if you nominate the New in Town, you might look evil, but it prevents the Alpha Wolf from doing so.",
  
  "If you are not bluffing as an Outsider, heap as much suspicion on the actual Outsiders as possible. They will usually be trusted by the good team, since it's obvious that a Baron is in play, and will need to be killed if you are to win.",
  
  "One option is getting your Alpha Wolf to kill you early on - players who die early at night are usually considered good, and you can use this position of trust to go around and talk to players, gathering information and feeding it back to the evil team, while also spreading misinformation. Whilst any Minion can use this strategy, of course, the Baron is particularly suited, since your devastating ability has already been used.",

Determining that there is a Baron is actually great news, since it means (especially in smaller games) that there is less likely to be a Poisoner, Spy or Successor.",
  "Because they don't benefit as much from staying alive as much as other Minions, Barons will often tend to be bolder and more aggressive with their bluffs or plays. A Baron does not fear death; they will deliberately double up with another player, try to get the first nomination of a New in Town, antagonize a Hunter, or otherwise just try to sow chaos. If you think a player might be having a little bit too much fun with the chaos they seem to be creating, they may be a Baron!",
  "Unlike the other Minions, the Baron's effect on the game happens before anything else and cannot be changed.

Taking out an evil vote can be advantageous, but if you have a better option (e.g. A lead on the Alpha Wolf or Poisoner), then take care of that instead.",

"Co-ordinate with your Alpha Wolf so that you are not selecting the same players - unless they are a character like the Ravenkeeper, you'll just be wasting your poison for the day!",

"Targeting characters like the New in Town, Hunter or Mayor can be excellent, but only if they use their ability while they are poisoned. You'll need to convince them to use their ability, or time it right so that they are compromised at the moment they choose to activate.",

"It's risky, but you can poison your own Alpha Wolf, and use the lack of death for that night to bluff as the Monk or Soldier. (You should probably warn your Alpha Wolf you're going to do this!)",

"If everyone is on board with the idea, try poisoning the Successor. If the Imp chooses to kill themselves, the Successor will become the new Alpha Wolf... unless you poison them first! That way, you or a third Minion can become the new Imp and keep the Successor in play. Just don't get your Imp killed while the Successor is still poisoned!",

"You will usually be more efficient as a Poisoner by selecting multiple targets around the town rather than focusing on one player for the entire game. You only really need to poison the Seer on the night they're checking your Alpha Wolf, for example - then you're free to mess with other characters. This method of poisoning is also more difficult to detect than sticking to one player.",

"On the other hand, if you only poison one player, that player might end up looking like the Village Idiot, perhaps hiding the real Village Idiot, or making it look like a Baron is in play.",

"On the first night, if you don't know who to poison, poison a player sitting next to the Alpha Wolf. You know which player is the Alpha Wolf, and on the off chance that an Empath is sitting next to the Alpha Wolf, you'll be giving some very damaging information to the good team.",

  "The Poisoner is unlikely to target you because of your ability on the first night, since they don't know anyone but their fellow evil players and will be acting blindly. Therefore, you can usually trust that your ability will work correctly on the first night and day. This is particularly important for characters like the New in Town and the Hunter, who only get to use their abilities once, as well as the Housekeeper, Librarian, Investigator, and Chef.",
  
  "The Poisoner will especially want to target characters who get information over multiple nights, such as the Empath, Gravedigger or Seer. They will also be keen to undermine characters like the Hunter, who can kill their Alpha Wolf. If you think a Poisoner is in play, be cautious about these characters and their information, especially if they have come out publicly. However, if you believe a player has been poisoned, you can usually assume they were given false information by the Storyteller.",

  "Separating the Poisoner from the Village Idiot can be crucial. Knowing that you have one in play might signal what else is in the game. Uncovering a Village Idiot might tell you that the Recluse is telling you the truth, or that the Butler might be lying. The Librarian or Investigator, Gravedigger, and Ravenkeeper can be the best ways to find out which is in play, but a lot of different people getting wrong information might point to the Poisoner.",
  
  "Be alert for characters who suddenly start getting inconsistent information, especially if they have recently revealed to the group. For example, an Empath who is still sitting between the same neighbours but is suddenly getting a different number to the previous nights is likely poisoned.",
  
  "In the absence of more obvious targets, poisoners typically will end up targeting players that are:\n- Strong or outspoken, especially if they are rallying or leading the good team\n- Friends or loved ones - it's hard to resist!\n- Quiet, or are trying not to attract attention; these look like they have something to hide.",
  
  "Unlike other Minions, the Poisoner is deadly throughout the entire game so long as they are alive. If you have a lead on a suspected Poisoner, it is always to your benefit to take them out as early in the game as possible. For example, an Investigator may know that one of two players is the Poisoner; it is best to execute them both. Alternatively, two players may be claiming to be the same character; this is usually an indication a Minion is doubling up with an existing good player, and eliminating both of them removes the Poisoner from contention.",
