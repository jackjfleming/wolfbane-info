    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Village Idiot will never know that they are the Village Idiot - they will start the game with a Townsfolk token and behave as that Townsfolk normally while receiving bad information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Figuring out if a Village Idiot is in play is important - this will allow Townsfolk to know whether or not they should be scrutinizing their information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you suspect a Village Idiot is in play, it is important to determine which of the Townsfolk it is as soon as possible. There can only be one Village Idiot in play, so knowing who it is will allow you to treat their information skeptically.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Differentiating the effects of a Village Idiot from a Poisoner can be difficult, but crucial. If only one person seems to be receiving false information, they might be the Village Idiot.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Characters like the Gravedigger and Ravenkeeper will see the Village Idiot character when checking that player. You do not register as a Townsfolk - you just think you are!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you have figured out you are the Village Idiot, try to reverse engineer what you know. For example, if you thought you were the Empath and have been getting a read of '0', you should be suspicious that you have at least one evil neighbor after all.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 alpha-wolf">Bluffing As</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You would not know that you are the Village Idiot at first. You would receive a Townsfolk character. The Storyteller would treat you as if you were that Townsfolk.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Village Idiot is the only good character that you can claim to be without another good character calling you out for claiming the same character as them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Bluff as a character that gains information more passively, such as the Seer, Investigator, Empath, Housekeeper, Gravedigger or Librarian and give deliberately and obviously false information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Bluff as a character that has a power that can fail, then when your fake ability fails, act surprised, and put forward the possibility that you are the Village Idiot.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Insinuate a Village Idiot is in play, and lead the group on a hunt to find out who it is. This will distract them from the main goal of finding the Alpha Wolf, and will make them distrust their own good team.</p>
