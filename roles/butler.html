    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 outsider">Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The player who you choose as your 'Master' is very important. Your vote still counts as much as a normal vote, it is just that you will not be able to vote at all if your Master has their hand down. So, spend a good deal of time listening, and being involved in figuring out which players are good.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you tell your Master that you have selected them, they will often vote under the assumption that you will be voting with them. Observing how your Master wants you to vote can give you some hints as to whether your Master is good or evil.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Even though you may not vote unless your Master has their hand up to vote too, you do not have to vote just because they do. Remember to only vote for players you truly believe are evil, or otherwise deserve it!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The player you choose as your Master will usually trust you, and want to keep you alive. After all, you are in their power! It is in their best interest to help you survive, so building up that trust may come in handy if anybody nominates you for execution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You can choose a dead player as your Master, but do this carefully - as dead players only have one remaining vote, they may not use it for a while, meaning that you might not be able to vote at all.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If particular other players think that you are evil, and want to execute you, you can often win their support by promising to be their Butler tonight. If you ask them not to nominate or vote for you today, and in return you will choose them as your master tonight, they will often agree, and keep you alive.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You may choose a dead player to be your Master. Sometimes, you will do so without intending to, if you and the Alpha Wolf choose the same player.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 alpha-wolf">Bluffing As</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You would wake each night, including the first night, and select a player. The day after, you would only be allowed to vote if that player is also voting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Nobody suspects the Butler! It's silly, but it's true; since you don't seem like much of a threat and it is easy for you to associate yourself with good players, the Butler is a great bluff for good and evil players alike.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You don't have to stick to a single Master, but choosing one player repeatedly will help you build trust with that individual more easily.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Giving your vote to a good player is a great way to get them to trust you in the absence of other evidence. People like it when you trust them, and the act of making someone your Master is a great way of building trust.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You can actually vote freely, but nobody else will know that. Players who think they are your Master tend to view your vote as a bonus to their own, rather than you operating independently of them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you really need to vote but have aligned yourself with a persnickety Master, you can just 'vote' with another Master and claim that you swapped Masters secretly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You can retroactively decide who your Master was each day. Pay attention to who's voting with you, then when asked who your Master was, name someone who voted with you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You can coerce your Master into voting for the player(s) you want them to vote for, by threatening to choose a different Master if they don't let you vote for the players you want to vote for.</p>
