    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 villager">Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Your goal is to keep valuable good players alive and stall the Alpha Wolf's mayhem. Try to predict who the Alpha Wolf may target each night based on the available information in the game and how the players are acting. Every Alpha Wolf is different, and figuring out the methodology of yours can enable you to save more than one player.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Don't try to predict what the Alpha Wolf will do. Instead, talk to your fellow players and find someone to keep alive at all costs. Valuable characters, such as the Seer or Empath, or players that you trust, such as a confirmed New in Town can survive for entire games under your protection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you find a Hunter or a New in Town, you can convince them not to use their ability right away, since you can protect them. This will enable them to use their once per game abilities later, when more information is on the table.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You are the only player that you cannot protect, and if you thwart the Alpha Wolf, they are probably going to want to identify and kill you, so try to avoid the Alpha Wolf's attention. You can do this by bluffing as a low priority target for the Alpha Wolf like the Chef, or an undesirable one like the Ravenkeeper or Soldier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Coming out publicly as the Bodyguard can let you coordinate with the good team, finding the best choice for your protection that night. Even if you die, you are protecting the town; the night the Alpha Wolf had to spend killing you was a night the Alpha Wolf wasn't killing your Gravedigger or New in Town. Beware of the Poisoner if you take this route! They can disable you and let the Alpha Wolf kill freely.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you successfully protect someone at night, you can be reasonably certain that they are good, since the Alpha Wolf wanted them dead. The only exception is the Alpha Wolf, who has the special ability to die and pass their Alpha Wolfhood onto one of their Minions, but the chances of this are slim.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you suspect that someone is the Alpha Wolf and about to kill themselves to move the Alpha Wolf, you can deliberately protect them, preventing them from doing so.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Misdirect the Alpha Wolf about who you are going to protect. You can do this publicly or by privately whispering to select players. If the Alpha Wolf believes you are guarding the Seer, they may not target them, leaving you free to provide your actual protection to someone else. Keeping the evil team guessing is a good way to spread your 'protection' among multiple players. Be aware, though, that if the player that you say you're going to protect dies, it might make you look evil, so consider confiding in them that they won't actually be protected.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you wake up and nobody is dead, you might not have protected anyone. The Alpha Wolf may have attacked a Soldier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If think you've successfully protected your target, ask them to bluff as the Soldier. This will cause the Alpha Wolf to think they are not worth targeting again, and mask your existence for another night.</p>
        </div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 alpha-wolf">Bluffing As</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Storyteller would have woken you on nights that the Alpha Wolf wakes - every night except the first - and you would have pointed to a player.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Your choice for who you 'protect' should have some logic behind it. If a publicly revealed Seer dies on your watch, that can be a big clue that you are not who you say you are. However, if you tell the group that you don't believe that the Seer is telling the truth, and that you instead protected a player that has privately revealed that they are the Empath to you, your choices seem much more reasonable. You can come up with all sorts of reasons about why you protected player A instead of player B, particularly if you prepare what you are going to say beforehand.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Alpha Wolf can choose to pick a dead player instead of an alive player at night. If you are claiming to be the Bodyguard, getting the Alpha Wolf to do this supports your bluff. When nobody dies at night, all players will want to know why. This also means that the player you claimed to have protected from the Alpha Wolf will look more trustworthy, since the Alpha Wolf almost always attacks good players. The player that you claim to protect is likely to be seen by other players as the same alignment as you, so you can either ingratiate yourself by claiming to have picked a good player, or back up the Alpha Wolf by saying you picked them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Bodyguard usually operates in secret, not revealing who they are to the group until they have successfully protected a player from death. You can use this secrecy as an excuse to talk to many players in private, either spreading lies to the good players, or coordinating with your evil team mates. If anybody asks why you are being so secretive, the players that believe you are the Bodyguard will come to your defense.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you are still alive on the final day, and a player has died each night this game, the good players will probably be convinced that you are either a particularly inept Bodyguard, or just evil. If you are a Minion, this can be quite helpful, since the good players will want to execute you, ending the game with an evil victory.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You can draw attention to yourself as a Minion by claiming to have protected the player who died last night. There are legitimate reasons why it might have happened - you could be the Village Idiot or poisoned, but providing such an outlandish topic of discussion distracts from the information that the Seer has pointing directly at your Alpha Wolf.</p>
