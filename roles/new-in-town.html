        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p>The Housekeeper nominates the New in Town. The Housekeeper is immediately executed and the day ends.</p>

            <p>The Village Idiot, who thinks they are the Chef, nominates the New in Town. The Village Idiot remains alive, and the New in Town loses their ability. Players may now vote on whether or not to execute the New in Town. (This happens because the Village Idiot is not a Townsfolk.)</p>

            <p>A dead player nominates the New in Town. The dead, however, cannot nominate. The Storyteller declares that the nomination does not count. The New in Town does not lose their ability.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You are one of the few Townsfolk in the game that can be absolutely confirmed as good. If a player is executed for nominating you, that is absolute and undeniable proof that you are the New in Town.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Characters who have received their information or have used their ability already (like the Housekeeper, Investigator or Hunter) are great choices to encourage into nominating you. Not only will they and their information be validated by their death, but they don't lose out on gaining any more information as the game continues.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Characters like the Gravedigger, Seer or even Empath are great choices if they have received a little information and want to confirm they are good, or if they are under suspicion and want to remove themselves as a potential Alpha Wolf.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> An Outsider who nominates you will not be executed. Your ability requires your nominator to be a Townsfolk, not merely good.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't like any of your potential suitors? You can nominate yourself and trigger your ability, proving you are the New in Town! This can prevent an evil Minion or hapless Outsider from wasting your ability.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Once your ability activates, the nominator is immediately executed, ending the day (even if someone else had the votes and was due to be executed). Using this strategically can allow you to block an execution from happening in addition to proving yourself as good.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you are known to be the New in Town but haven't used your ability yet, you are a prime target for death or poisoning. Using your ability early minimizes this risk and allows you to be a rally point for the good team to work around.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Waiting a couple of days before announcing that you're the New in Town can give you a chance to decide who should nominate you. A player being proven good, a few days into the game, can completely unravel an evil narrative.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Not claiming to be the New in Town until you get nominated can be a powerful strategy to uncover an evil player who is claiming to be a Townsfolk, but might not be willing to nominate you if you were to claim to be the New in Town.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you can find a player that is claiming to be the Bodyguard, convince them to protect you every night. Since you no longer have to fear death in the night, you can always wait another day to get somebody to nominate you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If your ability doesn't activate, this can mean a few things: The person who did the nominating is evil! Evil players can nominate the New in Town so that your ability does not activate, leaving you unable to be confirmed and throwing you both into doubt. The person who nominated is an Outsider. This includes the Village Idiot, who thinks they are a Townsfolk. You are in fact the Village Idiot or poisoned, so you have no ability.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Your ability only triggers the first time you are nominated. Even if you were poisoned or nominated by a non-Townsfolk, your ability is already spent, and you can no longer cause an execution from your ability.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Beware the Spy! It is the only evil character that can activate your ability, since it registers as a Townsfolk.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Bluffing As</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> You would never wake during the night. Pay attention to who is the first person to nominate you; it's only the first nomination that counts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> A good player will never be executed due to nominating you. This means that when you are nominated, one of you will look evil, or at least village idiot. If you can, get a player that the group is suspicious might be evil to nominate you. This way, if they are believed to be evil, you will be believed to be good.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> If a New in Town is nominated, but either player is the Village Idiot, the New in Town ability does not trigger, since either the New in Town is the Village Idiot (not the New in Town), or the nominating player is an Outsider (not a Townsfolk). When nobody dies after nominating you, you can usually make a strong case that one of you is the Village Idiot. This has the added benefit of any real Village Idiot going undetected by the group, or an outsider, perhaps even a Saint, being executed because the good team think there are too many Outsiders in play.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> If you are a Minion, you can get your Alpha Wolf to nominate you and then bring suspicion on yourself. The more evil you look, the less evil the Alpha Wolf looks, since your Alpha Wolf will be the 'victim' of your bluff, and players will be more inclined to trust them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> Beware bluffing as the New in Town if a real New in Town is in play. If you have told the group that you are the New in Town, and the real New in Town proves themself by getting a Townsfolk executed, you can not possibly be the New in Town. You will need to get an evil character to nominate the real New in Town so that this doesn't happen, so the good team remains confused about who the real New in Town is.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> Bluffing as the New in Town, being nominated, then continuing to live afterwards, is a great opportunity to come up with another bluff. Claiming that you are actually the Gravedigger, or the Bodyguard for example, can be believable even if you claimed to be the New in Town for the first day or two. Since the Alpha Wolf will usually rather not kill a New in Town that is under suspicion of being evil, and instead want to kill an Gravedigger, or a Bodyguard, then 'lying about who you were temporarily' can be very believable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> If you are confident that the group believes you are the New in Town, then insist that the player who is the most dangerous to you be the one to nominate you! They will look evil when you don't die. For example, if an Empath is giving the evil team a lot of trouble, you can insist that they nominate you, which will discredit them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> Bluffing as the New in Town can be particularly potent if you are a Minion, since a good team who believes that either you or the person who nominated you is evil might spend two days executing both of you and not executing your Alpha Wolf.</p>
