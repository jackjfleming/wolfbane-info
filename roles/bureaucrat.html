        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p>The Bureaucrat chooses Evin. The next day, when the first vote is being tallied, the Storyteller counts '1... 2... 3... 4-5-6... 7.' The nominated player now has seven votes for their execution, and the nomination process continues.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p>The Bureaucrat chooses Filip. The next day, Filip has a triple vote, which he uses during four nominations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p>The Bureaucrat chooses Douglas, who is dead. The next day, Douglas uses his vote token to vote, and his vote counts as triple.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Tips & Tricks (If Good)</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're good:</strong> Choose players you trust to have triple voting power. This can help ensure that the right players get executed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're good:</strong> Coordinate with the player you choose. Let them know they have triple votes so they can use them strategically.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're good:</strong> Be careful about choosing players who might be evil. Giving an evil player triple votes can be very dangerous.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're good:</strong> You can choose dead players too. Their vote tokens will count as triple votes.</p>
        </div>

<section class="mb-8">
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Tips & Tricks (If Evil)</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're evil:</strong> Don't choose evil players ALL the time - that will look too suspicious. If you just choose the Alpha Wolf over and over again, the good team has reason to believe that you are evil, as good Bureaucrats tend to change their minds more often.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're evil:</strong> Another strategy is to choose good players until the perfect moment arises. This works best if the players you choose for the first half of the game are not only good, but believed to be good by the group.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're evil:</strong> Choose an evil player on the final day. Although it might be tempting to choose a good player on the final day, so that you look more trustworthy, a good player having triple voting power is a huge danger to your team.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're evil:</strong> Choose dead evil players, if you can justify your reason for doing so. The dead are generally more trustworthy than the living, so giving a dead Minion triple votes not only helps your image, but gets that brutal extra two votes for the evil teams' desired nominee.</p>
