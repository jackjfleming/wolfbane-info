    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Say that the good twin is the Evil Twin. Say it again, and again, and again. After all, that's what the good twin will be doing!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Claim that you are the same character as the good twin. On the first night, you learn the character of the good twin, and they learn yours. This is a hint to help you know a character that is safe to bluff as.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Be passionate, not relaxed. Since the game end, and evil wins, whenever the good twin is executed, the good twin is almost always very vocal and insistent that they do not be executed under any circumstances.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Get the good twin executed, however you can. Give false information that indicates that your fellow evil players information is true. Give true information so that you look more trustworthy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you are the Alpha Wolf, cease killing at some stage, to pretend that the Alpha Wolf was executed that day. Normally, if the Alpha Wolf is executed, the game continues (the Evil Twin character says that while the Evil Twin is alive, 'Good can not win').</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you are the Alpha Wolf, feel free to try riskier bluffs that you may not otherwise feel fully capable of succeeding with. Since the game continues if you die, it matters less than normal if you are executed.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">To Fight</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>To Fight:</strong> If two players claim that each other are the Evil Twin, then you can safely assume that you have an Evil Twin in play. If there is only one Minion in this game, you know you are safe from the Witch, the Cerenovus and the Pit-Hag.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>To Fight:</strong> Once you have determined that an Evil Twin is in play, because two players are claiming that the other is the Evil Twin, then there is no rush to execute either of them. If you make a foolish decision early in the game and execute the wrong twin, good loses.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>To Fight:</strong> The good team MUST execute the Evil Twin in order for the good team to have a chance at winning. And they must NOT execute the good twin, or good immediately loses.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>To Fight:</strong> Compare both twin's information, to determine which twin is which. If both twins are claiming to be the Artist's but are giving conflicting information, follow each of their claims and see if you can determine which one is true.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>To Fight:</strong> If only 1 person accuses a player of being the Evil Twin, trust the accuser, not the accused. Most Evil Twins will also claim that their accuser is the Evil Twin, but not always.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>To Fight:</strong> When killings stop happening of a night time, you have almost certainly executed the Alpha Wolf. Since the game continues when the Alpha Wolf dies (the Evil Twin's ability says 'good can not win' whilst the Evil Twin is alive), then once the killings stop, the Alpha Wolf is probably dead.</p>
