            <p>The Beggar cannot vote. On the fourth day, the Bodyguard gives her vote token to the Beggar. The Beggar may now vote (once), and learns that the player is good. The Beggar is evil and tells the group that the Bodyguard player is evil.</p>

            <p>The good Beggar has three vote tokens. The Recluse gives the Beggar their vote token, and the Beggar learns that they are evil. That day, the Beggar dies, and loses all their vote tokens except for one.</p>

            <p><strong>If you're good:</strong> Learn the alignment of as many players as possible. Take vote tokens from as many players as possible. Even though by talking to the Alpha Wolf you can learn the alignments of all players quickly, the more players that give you their vote tokens, the more players will not be able to vote on the final day. You'll be able to vote as much as you want, and that is a powerful enough ability to win the game. Good players often don't realize how powerful their dead vote is - 1 player giving it away to an evil Beggar might not make much difference, but 4 players doing so will make a huge difference.</p>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're good:</strong> If you are good, you want to learn the alignment of as many players as possible. This information is incredibly valuable to the good team. However, be careful about who you share this information with - evil players might try to mislead you about their alignment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're good:</strong> You can use your vote tokens strategically. Save them for crucial votes, especially on the final day when every vote counts.</p>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're good:</strong> Be aware that evil players might try to give you their vote tokens to learn false information about their alignment. Use other information sources to verify what you learn.</p>

            <p><strong>If you're evil:</strong> You can use the Beggar claim to explain why you're not voting much, or to justify asking for vote tokens from dead players.</p>
