        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p>The Mayor is executed today. That night, the Gravedigger is shown the Mayor token.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p>The Village Idiot, who thinks they are the New in Town, is executed today. At night, the Gravedigger is shown the Village Idiot token, because the Gravedigger learns a player's true character, as opposed to the one they believe they are.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p>The Spy is executed. Two Travelers are exiled. That night, the Gravedigger is shown the Butler token, because the Spy is registering as the Butler, and because the exiles are not executions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p>Nobody was executed today. That night, the Gravedigger does not wake.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The more players that are executed, the more information you get. It's to your benefit to facilitate as many executions as you can. The good team's main method for killing evil players is execution as they are far less likely to die at night, so every execution is a chance to hit the Alpha Wolf. If you don't, you'll at least arrive on the final day knowing a lot more about your fellow players and their roles.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You do not learn the identity of Travelers; they are exiled, not executed. The only exception to this is the Scapegoat, since they are explicitly executed by their character ability. However, you do not learn their alignment, only their character.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Executing someone when you don't know their identity can lend credence to your claim as the Gravedigger. Alternatively, executing someone who has come out and is claiming a particular character allows you to confirm their story, as you will learn what character they are. Both are great ways to build trust with your fellow good team members.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Good candidates for early executions are characters like the Housekeeper and the Librarian, as confirming their identity allows you to also confirm other good players. Executing the Investigator or Chef doesn't confirm any other players, but still does mean you can trust their powerful information and perhaps quickly execute the troublesome Poisoner.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Executing a character like the Seer may mean they don't get any more information, but you can confirm them and everything they've said up until that point. If they die during the night, they can no longer be confirmed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Coming out early opens you up to risks of death or poisoning. Waiting to reveal your information until a critical moment can maximise the amount of information you receive. Make sure to come out before the end of the game!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Coming out as soon as possible is a good choice if you've learned something critical, such as the identity of the Alpha Wolf. If you are shown that the executed player was the Alpha Wolf, it is very likely that a Successor just took over as the Alpha Wolf!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If an executed player is the Village Idiot, you will see the Village Idiot character token, not the Townsfolk they thought they were.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you see that a player is a good character, you can trust them, and claim what you are to them. Then, when you eventually reveal yourself as the Gravedigger, the executed players will be able to back you up.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you see an evil character token, it is typically unwise to be truthful with the player who was just executed. You may still want to claim to be the Gravedigger and pretend to back up their bluff, so that the Alpha Wolf and Poisoner might avoid you in future nights.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> A player who dies because of the New in Town is considered executed and will react to your ability, so you will learn who they are that night.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Beware the Spy and the Recluse! They will likely register to you as good and evil characters respectively, as their abilities continue to function even when they are dead.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Bluffing As</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> Each night, apart from the first night, the Storyteller would have woken you up and shown you the character token of the player who was executed yesterday.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> A good Gravedigger may very well wait a few days before revealing that they are the Gravedigger. Feel free to stay quiet for a while, or even claim to be a different character at first, to seem like an Gravedigger bluffing as something else.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> You can make yourself look good by confirming that good players are who they say they are. For this strategy to be successful you will need to find out who they are beforehand. If you are the Spy, or have access to a Spy, then you can be more convincing in this due to your complete knowledge of everybody's characters.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> You can make key players look evil by claiming that they are Minions, or even the Alpha Wolf, if they are executed. This is risky, as the player in question will know that you are probably evil, but potentially game winning, as the rest of the group won't know that you are lying. Since most of the time more good players will be getting executed than evil players, use this technique sparingly. If you find that you aren't believed, you can always claim to be the Village Idiot or poisoned.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> If another Evil player dies by execution, you can safely claim that they are either a good or evil character. If you claim that they are a good character, both of you confirm each other's stories, so you both look more trustworthy. If you claim that they are an evil character, they should (hopefully) act a little more evil, and publicly subtly imply that they are, in fact, evil, making you appear to be the real Gravedigger.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> A good way to undermine an executed Townsfolk character is to claim you saw the Village Idiot token for them instead. If the group believes you (and especially if the executed player believes you), then the group will assume that any information they received was unreliable. If you don't know which character a player is, claiming that they are the Village Idiot is a good way to hide this fact.</p>
