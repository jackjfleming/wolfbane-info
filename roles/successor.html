    <div class="space-y-3">
 <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    The Successor is at her strongest when you co-ordinate with the Alpha Wolf and figure out a strategy that you both like, since the Alpha Wolf can safely die. Maybe you accuse the Alpha Wolf of being evil, and the Alpha Wolf does everything possible to make the good team think they are indeed evil? This makes you look very good, and trustworthy. Maybe the Alpha Wolf kills themselves of a night time and claims to be the Ravenkeeper, saying that you are the character you say you are. Maybe the Alpha Wolf accuses you of being evil, but does so unconvincingly, so that you look good by comparison. Maybe you and the Alpha Wolf both claim to be the same character, such as the Mayor? After all, "one of you must be the Mayor", right? It doesn't matter which one of you dies, since the game continues with a living Alpha Wolf either way.
</div>

<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    In the early game, staying alive is more important for you compared to other Minions. Whist it doesn't really matter if the Baron, or Poisoner dies early (since they can often cause a lot of disruption early in the game), you will need to survive until the end of the game if you intend to become the Alpha Wolf at some point. Waiting, listening, then claiming to be a character that you know is not in play often achieves this best.
</div>

<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Timing is important. Remember that if fewer than five players are alive when the Alpha Wolf dies, the game is over and good wins. If your Alpha Wolf has a lot of heat on them, and you think that they won't survive to the final day, take action and get your Alpha Wolf killed while five or more players are still alive... before it's too late.
</div>

<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Whilst you are the Successor, you will not register as the Alpha Wolf. So, if you can get yourself confirmed as such by good characters, such as the Hunter or the Fortune Teller, then become the Alpha Wolf at a later stage, then the good team will be very confused about the identity of the real Alpha Wolf, as their information won't add up.
</div>

<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    If the Alpha Wolf is playing well, and seems to be trusted by the good team, there is no need to use your ability. You can play the normal Minion role of spreading false information, breeding distrust among the good players and generally being troublesome whilst ignoring your character ability.
</div>

    <div class="space-y-3">
    <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
        When the Successor is in play, the Alpha Wolf can get away with doing certain things they would not be able to otherwise. For example, they can be successfully executed, or die by a Hunter's ability and the game will continue. If you are certain that you definitely took out the Alpha Wolf but the game is still going, you should be suspicious that a Successor is in play. It is possible for a Gravedigger to correctly see the Alpha Wolf token without being the Village Idiot!
    </div>

    <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
        If the Alpha Wolf kills themselves at night, the Alpha Wolfhood must always pass to the Successor first before any other Minions. This can allow you to narrow down where the new Alpha Wolf has ended up if the Alpha Wolf gets away from you.
    </div>

    <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
        The Alpha Wolf and the Successor may co-ordinate on their bluffs to confirm each other. For example, the Successor may claim to be the Housekeeper and "confirm" the Alpha Wolf's claim. This has the benefit of making them both look good, and potentially set up passing on the Alpha Wolfhood later in the game.
    </div>

    <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
        The Successor does not register as an Alpha Wolf, which means characters who detect Alpha Wolves specifically will appear to get a clean read on them. For example, the Fortune Teller will not detect them, and the Hunter ability will not work on them. Be wary of players who are overeager to be checked or confirmed, especially early in the game.
    </div>

    <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
        If you know a Successor is in play (e.g. Getting a read from an Investigator or a Ravenkeeper), then a good strategy can be to leave them alive. On the final days when three players are left alive, you no longer have to answer the question "who is the Alpha Wolf", but "did the Alpha Wolf pass to the Successor". If you think they did, you execute the Successor. If you don't think they did, you eliminate the Successor from contention and now have a one in two shot at the Alpha Wolf overall.
    </div>

    <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
        Unlike other Minions, the Successor can be bolder about targeting their own Alpha Wolf, and may even deliberately try to get them killed to make themselves look better. If you suspect someone is a Successor, pay close attention to who they are targeting, and if their allegiances abruptly change; if they have been targeting a particular player and then change their tune once it gets below five players, then that may very well be their Alpha Wolf.
    </div>

    <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
        The Successor is usually a backup plan, not a phase two; if the Alpha Wolf is well integrated into the town or not under much suspicion, the Successor may end up behaving more like a regular Minion, and sacrifice themselves more freely. If you discover a Successor throwing themselves on their sword, it can be worthwhile to be suspicious of players who have been considered trustworthy up until that point.
