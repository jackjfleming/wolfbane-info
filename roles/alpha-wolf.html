    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Examples</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p>It is the first night. The Alpha Wolf learns that Evin and Sarah are the Minions. The Alpha Wolf also learns that the Bodyguard, Chef, and Librarian are not in play. The Alpha Wolf bluffs as the Chef, then bluffs as Mayor halfway through the game. Eventually, the Alpha Wolf is executed and good wins.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p>On the third night, there are just five players left alive, including the Alpha Wolf and the Successor. The Alpha Wolf kills themselves, so the Successor becomes the new Alpha Wolf. The game continues.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p>There are lots of reasons why you should register as an evil Alpha Wolf to good players. If this happens, don't despair! Maybe you can convince the group that Empath is village idiot? Maybe you can argue that you are that Seer's 'red herring'?</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Stay alive during the day at all costs. Even in games with three Minions, do not assume there is a Successor in play.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Kill players who are giving the good team the most useful information. Empath, Seer, and Gravedigger are all high-priority targets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If someone unexpectedly dies at an odd time, or after coming under a lot of suspicion, you may have just seen the Alpha Wolf kill themselves and pass the Alpha Wolfhood on to one of their Minions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The Alpha Wolf's ability to kill means that they can be extremely effective at removing characters that pose a threat to them, and they will do so with gusto.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Unlike other Alpha Wolfs you may encounter, the Alpha Wolf's special ability to pass on the Alpha Wolfhood to their Minions puts them in the unique position of being able to get away with more complicated bluffing strategies.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">To Fight</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>To Fight:</strong> You wake every night except the first, and choose a player to kill. You should have a story ready for why certain players died and others didn't.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>To Fight:</strong> If you are the Alpha Wolf, you can come out publicly as the Seer and strategically die at night to make your information sound more legitimate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>To Fight:</strong> If you are the Successor, you can publicly accuse your actual Alpha Wolf and lead the charge for their execution. This gives characters like the Gravedigger a positive read of 'Alpha Wolf', solidifying your bluff.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>To Fight:</strong> The Alpha Wolf can pass on their Alpha Wolfhood to a Baron! Ignoring the Baron until it is too late might put you in a difficult position of trying to figure out if they have become the Alpha Wolf on the final day.</p>
