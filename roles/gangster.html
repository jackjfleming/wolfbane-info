            The Gangster neighbors the Saint and the Baron. The Gangster asks the Baron if they want to kill the Saint. The Baron agrees and the Saint dies.

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Gangster neighbours the Chambermaid and the Poppy Grower, but they are both dead. The Gangster's two living neighbours are the Engineer and the Po. The Gangster talks with the Po and offers to kill the Engineer. The Po declines. The Gangster talks with the Engineer and the Engineer asks the Gangster to kill the Po. The Gangster agrees, and the Po dies. Good wins.

            The Gangster neighbours the Fool and the Sage. The Sage and the Gangster kill the Fool but the Fool doesn't die, because of the Fool's ability. The Gangster may not use their ability again today.

    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Find out the characters of your living neighbors. They will know you are the Gangster. It is best if you know their characters too. Learn what they are before making any rash decisions on who to kill.
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Talk to each living neighbor. Convince them to "give you permission" to kill the other player, even if they think the other player is good. You are good, so being able to kill either living neighbor at any time is a powerful, and hopefully helpful, option to have. You can always choose not to kill either player, even if both players want you to kill the other.
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you can, kill every day. Just by playing the odds, killing two players per day (one by execution and one by Gangster) means that the good team is twice as likely to kill the Alpha Wolf and win. Even if you think both your living neighbors are good, it's worth it.
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            When choosing which player to kill, aim for evil players first. If you suspect someone of being evil, arrange for them to sleep with the fishes. If you don't really suspect either player of being evil, choose the player that has a character ability that seems less useful to the good team or the one that seems less willing to die.
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you believe that both your neighbors are good, and they both have character abilities that will continue to be useful for the rest of the game, don't kill today and don't ask for each player to kill the other. This way, they can both use their abilities to the fullest. You probably won't want to kill a Mayor, a Sage or a King, and if they die at night, then you will get to use your ability on a new living neighbor instead - your ability is also very useful, and it would be a shame to never use it.
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you think that a particular player is the Alpha Wolf (or even a Minion), then kill players that are sitting between you and them. Hopefully, in a day or two, you and the Alpha Wolf will be living neighbors and you can kill them with your ability.
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Before the final day, request that the group exile you. An evil Gangster that is alive when just 3 other players are left alive can win the game for the evil team by agreeing with the Alpha Wolf to kill another player. Getting yourself exiled means that you won't be able to use your ability on the final day, but it will be a show of good faith to the good team. If the good team believes that you are good, they will look at your previous kills as the best choices of a good player, and not erroneously assume that you were just killing good players because you were evil.
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Remember that you need your living neighbors to agree to use your ability. You can't just do it on their behalf. You'll need to make friends with them, and convince them that you are good and have the good team's interests at heart. They may not want you to use your ability, and with good reason.

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 alpha-wolf">Tips & Tricks (If Evil)</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If both your living neighbors are good, turn them against each other. If they both think that they are both good, they are unlikely to kill each other. Find some way to imply that at least one of them is evil, and one is likely to kill the other.
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If one of your living neighbors is evil, they have every reason to want to kill the other living neighbor. The trick won't be in convincing them to do it, but in coming up with a good reason why. Talk to your evil neighbor and help them formulate a valid reason to tell the group since evil players that are too gung-ho in using the Gangster may appear evil. You can even act reluctant to kill the other neighbor and claim that you are doing so only because there is no better choice.
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Get as many good players killed as possible. It doesn't matter how you do it. Every good player that dies is one fewer good player gaining information, one fewer player using an ability against the evil team,and one fewer good player voting.
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Get any non-Alpha Wolf player killed. Even if Minions die due to your ability, that means that the final day is sooner, and evil's victory is sooner. Similarly, if Outsiders die to your ability, then evil is closer to winning. Don't be too concerned about what each player's character is... as long as they are not the Alpha Wolf, they are probably best dead.
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Talk to any evil living neighbors before talking to any good living neighbors. Many players will want to kill the other player before that other player kills them, and talking to an evil neighbor first gives you a good excuse to kill the good player.
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Every so often, it is better for the evil team if certain characters die by execution. Characters such as the Good Twin (see the Evil Twin) or the Saint lose the game for the good team if executed, so it is best to not kill them using your Gangster ability. Beware of pushing too hard here, though, as there's little reason for a good Gangster to not be willing to kill a Saint.
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you suspect that a good neighbor is about to be nominated and executed, don't kill them with your Gangster ability today. A death by the Gangster's ability doesn't count as an execution, and the day will continue afterwards. It is more helpful to the evil team if the day ends after the death occurs, so that the Alpha Wolf can't accidentally be executed today as well.
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Choose players to die so that the distance between you and the Alpha Wolf is maximized. Since the Gangster can only kill living neighbors, the good players may have some very strong opinions on which of your living neighbors should die. If one of your living neighbors is the Alpha Wolf, they may put a lot of pressure on you to kill them, and while you can always choose not to, this may end up looking incredibly suspicious and reveal that you are evil and know who the Alpha Wolf is. It is best to avoid this situation by never neighboring the Alpha Wolf in the first place. When the Alpha Wolf is sitting 2, 3, 4, or more players away from you, keep it that way by killing players in the opposite direction.
