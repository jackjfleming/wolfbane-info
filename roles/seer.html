    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 villager">Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Getting a 'no' is often more useful than getting a 'yes'. A 'no' means that neither of the two players is the Alpha Wolf, which narrows down the number of players you have to inspect.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You only learn about Alpha Wolfs. Just because you got a 'no' on somebody doesn't mean that they're good. They could still be a Minion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you have a pair of players who you got a 'yes' on, and a pair of players you got a 'no' on, try picking one player from each pair. If you get another 'yes', you know that the player you got a 'yes' on both times is the player you're getting a read on; otherwise, it's the player in your initial 'yes' pair that you didn't pick this time that you should look to.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you have gotten a 'yes' on players you are suspicious of, getting confirmation of which player is causing your ability to react can give you a clear goal, especially if that player is still alive at the end of the game.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You only have a limited number of nights to gather information. Spending a lot of it focusing on one or two people may give you less to work with in the end game. For this reason, it's usually most efficient to start the game casting a wide net and learn about as many pairs as possible. Then, after you have some general information, start focusing on the players you are most suspicious of.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Remember that the Alpha Wolf can kill themselves and cause a Minion to become the Alpha Wolf, and if they're executed, the Successor might become the Alpha Wolf. Even if you got a 'no' on someone earlier in the game doesn't mean they aren't the Alpha Wolf now. If you think the Alpha Wolf died, try picking someone you think is a Minion that you previously got a 'no' on and see if your information has changed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Your false positive is chosen at the beginning of the game and does not move, and you will not receive a false read from more than one player because of your ability. Remember your false register can be anyone, including you, and a 'yes' is not a definite confirmation of a Alpha Wolf.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You can choose yourself as one of the two players. Since you know you are not the Alpha Wolf, this enables you to get a read on one specific player. Beware though, the Storyteller can make you your own false positive, so this may not always be effective.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Be aware of the Recluse, who may register as the Alpha Wolf to you. This is not the same as the Red Herring.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Claiming to be a character that the Alpha Wolf would not want to kill, such as the Saint, Soldier, or Ravenkeeper can help you survive longer, allowing you some much needed time to gain useful information.</p>
        </div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 alpha-wolf">Bluffing As</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You wake every night, including the first night, and should have information for each night you are alive. You would have pointed at two players and the Storyteller would have either nodded or shaken their head. When you reveal that you are the Seer, the good team will expect you to have a detailed explanation of every night's activities. Be prepared. Have what you are going to tell them ready.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You can lie that 'these two players are not the Alpha Wolf' to exonerate your fellow evil players.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Seer can sometimes get wildly confusing information. The Recluse may register as the Alpha Wolf. The Alpha Wolf itself can change players to someone who was previously a Minion, even if no Successor is in play. The 'Red Herring' can register as the Alpha Wolf, making a good player look suspicious. Worry less about the exact content of your information, and the number of 'yes' results you claim to have received, and more about acting with conviction.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Having noted the above point, your bluff is still increased dramatically if the information you reveal to the group is consistent. If you tell players over and over again that certain players are not the Alpha Wolf, they will tend to keep those players alive. If you tell players over and over again that certain players are possibly the Alpha Wolf, they will tend to kill them, but may come for you next when the game doesn't end afterwards.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If a good player is being particularly troublesome, focusing all your attention on them by claiming that they are registering as the Alpha Wolf to you can quickly get them killed. You can always claim that they must have been your 'Red Herring' after the fact. This strategy can be particularly devastating if you need to get a player executed, but can not do so by normal means. In particular, you can get a Saint executed or a Mayor or Soldier killed, or at least convince the good team not to trust them. Even sowing distrust about an Gravedigger, Empath, or similar character can be enough to make their information questionable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Remember that Seers may choose dead players, and may even choose themselves. Telling the group that a dead player is the Alpha Wolf implies that all their information was dubious, and also (in single Minion games) that only one remaining player is evil. This misinformation, whilst seemingly innocent, can sway the game in your direction due to the extra mistrust among the living players. It is particularly effective if you make a Ravenkeeper appear to be the Alpha Wolf that killed themselves at night time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you are the Alpha Wolf, you can come out publicly as the Seer and strategically die at night to make your information sound more legitimate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you are the Successor, you can publicly accuse your actual Alpha Wolf and lead the charge for their execution. This gives characters like the Gravedigger a positive read of 'Alpha Wolf', solidifying your bluff.</p>
