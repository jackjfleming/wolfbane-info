    The Alpha Wolf has been nominated. There are 10 players alive, and five votes for the Alpha Wolf, so the Alpha Wolf is about to die. The Gunslinger chooses a voting player to die. They die, and the nomination continues, with the Alpha Wolf still about to die.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    The players exile the Thief. Then, the Butler is nominated for execution and gets one vote. This is the first nomination for execution, since the Thief’s exile does not count. The Gunslinger chooses to kill the single voting player. Later that day, the Saint is nominated and six players vote. The Gunslinger cannot use their ability now because this is not the first vote for execution today.

    <div class="space-y-3">
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Hot diggity, you're the Gunslinger! Enjoy it while you can!
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Deaths caused by your ability are not executions, and as such, they don't cause the day to end, and nor does the character you shot get seen by the Gravedigger.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    You get the opportunity to kill a player each day. Make the most of it, and remember to let the Storyteller know that you wish to use your ability. Doing so every day practically doubles the good team's chance of killing the Alpha Wolf. Normally, each day / night, 2 players die - one due to the Alpha Wolf attack, and one due to the daily execution. If you use your ability each day, two thirds of all deaths are chosen by the good team. These are great odds.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Pay attention to the vibe of the group. Sometimes, the good players will not want you to kill a player each day. If you go against their desires, they may Exile you as soon as they can. Pay attention and get your fingers off the trigger if you want to stay alive.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Pay attention to who isn't voting on the first nomination each day. Minions may be a bit laissez faire, but Alpha Wolf players quickly learn how dangerous it can be to vote when you are in play. Alpha Wolves will usually not vote if they think there is even a small chance that you will shoot them. Use this information to your advantage! By executing those players that seem fearful of voting, you may luck upon the Alpha Wolf. Or, you may startle the Alpha Wolf into voting, which gives you a chance of killing them single-handedly.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    It's ok if a few innocent bystanders die. Don't be afraid to take out a supposed Gravedigger or a suspicious looking Recluse. As long as you kill a Minion or two as well, it was probably worth it.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    You are the perfect way to deal with the Saint. They can't be executed? You don't execute!
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    If you live until just 3 players are left alive, be very wary of who you kill. The Alpha Wolf may try to psyche you out and get you to kill a Minion (or a good player), which will reduce the player count to just 2 players... and evil wins. Beware.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Ignore all of the above advice, and never use your ability. Sit. Wait. Watch. Be passive and silent and unassuming. Watch people's body language and listen to what arguments they are making. When you think that you know who the Alpha Wolf is, say nothing, and wait until that player votes on the first nomination of the day - then BOOM. Either you've won the game and have one very surprised dead Alpha Wolf, or you blew it and killed a nobody.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    If there are 3 or more other Travelers in the game, you know that 1 of them is probably evil. It may be worth taking out an evil Traveler before they can do too much harm.

    <div class="space-y-3">
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Just like a good Gunslinger, it is best if you kill each day. After all, you have insider information on who you should be killing and who you shouldn't, so go nuts. The more destruction you cause, the quicker that the game will get to the final day, and the more evil players will be alive compared to good, which gives your team greater voting power. Just like a good gunslinger though, listen to the group's opinion on what your actions should be, and don't go kill crazy unless they want you to.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Obviously, shooting the Alpha Wolf is a bad idea, unless you know you have a Successor. Luckily, you know who the Alpha Wolf is, so that won't be a problem. But should you kill Minions? That depends. If Minions are looking suspicious, and you think that they may get executed soon anyway, putting a cap in that Minion's arse may be the best option. Each Minion that you kill reduces the living players by one - and that means that an evil victory is one step closer. Killing a Minion that has already used their ability, such as a Baron or a Spy, is probably more helpful than keeping them alive. Killing a Minion that still has trouble to cause, such as a Poisoner or Successor is probably a mistake.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Of course, if you want to avoid shooting Minions, you'll have to learn who they are - be sure to coordinate with your Alpha Wolf!
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Encourage the Alpha Wolf to vote. Since you'll not be killing them, they can vote freely. Tell the group that the players that are not voting are probably the Alpha Wolf.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    You can play it safe, if you want to stay alive longer. Each day, kill the player that looks the most suspicious, regardless of what character they are claiming to be. This will ingratiate you with the good team, because it looks like you are trying to kill evil players. You can even ask the other players who they think you should kill. If the good players see you repeatedly killing the players that they want to kill, you'll live a long time.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    You can throw caution to the wind, and kill the most dangerous, powerful good player to remove their ability from the game. If a Fortune Teller keeps getting fantastic information, and is believed to be trustworthy by the good team, you can quickly and easily neutralize that threat. The downside is that the good team will quickly vote to exile you afterwards. But there are situations where it is worth it. Another example is if a Soldier is in the game, and the good players overwhelmingly believe them, then you may foresee a troublesome final day where the Soldier is one of three living players. To avoid this situation, sacrificing yourself to remove the Soldier would be well worth it.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Use fear as a weapon. Nominate evil players, or bluff nominating evil players, and dare the good team to vote for it. You'll probably get exiled, but you can have some control over the execution for a day or two.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    If the good players are foolish enough to keep you alive until just 3 players are left alive (not including Travelers), you've basically won. As soon as the first vote happens, kill a non-Alpha Wolf player and seize victory.
