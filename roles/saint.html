        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Stay quiet, and hope that the evil players don't know who you are. If they nominate you, and you get executed, then evil wins. The less that evil knows about who you are, the better.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Alternatively, tell everyone who you are, so that the good team doesn't accidentally execute you. This strategy is more risky, because evil will also know who you are, but at least the good team can avoid executing you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you are nominated, you can always reveal that you are the Saint at that point. Good players will want to remove their votes, but evil players will probably keep their votes where they are.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 alpha-wolf">Bluffing As</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You would never wake, learn anything, or act during the day.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Saint is a great bluff for any evil player, but particularly Minions. If the good team believes that you are the Saint, they will not want to execute you. This keeps you alive, and keeps your vote in play.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you are nominated for execution, claim to be the Saint. Even if some good players suspect that you are evil, they probably won't want to take the risk.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you are the Alpha Wolf, bluffing as the Saint is more risky. If you are executed whilst claiming to be the Saint, and the game doesn't end, then the good team learns that you were not the Saint. They may execute you again the next day.</p>
