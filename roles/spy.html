            <p>The Housekeeper learns that either Abdallah or Douglas is the Ravenkeeper. Abdallah is the Bodyguard, and Douglas is the Spy registering as the Ravenkeeper.</p>

            <p>The Spy neighbors the Alpha Wolf and the Empath. The Chef learns a '1' because the Spy is registering as evil. Later that night, the Empath learns a '0' because the Spy is now registering as good.</p>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p>The Spy nominates the New in Town and is executed by the New in Town's ability, because the Storyteller chooses that the Spy registers as a Townsfolk. That night, the Gravedigger learns that the Village Idiot died today, because the Spy is now registering as the Village Idiot.</p>

    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You will usually register as a good player to characters like the Empath, Chef, and Gravedigger. Thanks to this, you will be able to gain the trust of good players much more easily than the other evil characters.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You also have access to information that is hard to guess or obtain as an evil player, like player's characters. This makes you an especially potent Housekeeper, Gravedigger or Ravenkeeper, since all of these characters learn that sort of information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Spy is particularly effective for bluffs that require more than one player. For example, you can claim to be the Housekeeper, Librarian or Ravenkeeper and back up your Alpha Wolf's character claim.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You are the only evil player that can activate the New in Town ability. Players who die this way are usually the most trusted characters in the game.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 villager">To Fight</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Detecting the Spy is the first step in fighting the Spy. For example, the Alpha Wolf kills may be a little bit too efficient.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you are a New in Town, Gravedigger or Ravenkeeper, be wary of players who seem too eager to die and prove who they are. Because the Spy can register as good, this might be their attempt to weasel their way into your good graces.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Spy is particularly good at bluffing as characters like the Housekeeper or the Ravenkeeper, as these characters detect information that is not usually available to the evil team until those players come out.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Alpha Wolf is more likely to kill themselves and pass their Alpha Wolfhood on if a Spy is in play due to the Spy's ability to integrate themselves into the town.</p>
