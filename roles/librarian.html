    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 villager">Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            It is vital to figure out early which of the two players is the one you have information about. The player that you know is good even if they are an Outsider - while their ability may be detrimental to the good team, they are a guaranteed good vote and also one player who you know for sure is definitely not the Alpha Wolf.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you get a 0, this information is super powerful if you aren't the Village Idiot or poisoned, as then you know for sure there are no Outsiders in the game. This means there is no Baron in play, and any Outsider claims are probably evil players bluffing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You learn your information on the first night of the game. Revealing what you know early can help confirm a player as good, which might in turn confirm other information from Villager like the Empath or the Ravenkeeper.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you do not reveal your information until late in the game and the player you are confirming is still alive, then you can reveal them on the final day or close to it, taking them out of contention as a potential Alpha Wolf and reducing the number of players for the good team to deliberate on from 3 to 2.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Because you get all of your information at the start of the game, you might find it useful to confirm it by nominating a New in Town. Alternatively, you might want to claim to be something more powerful to incite the Alpha Wolf into attacking you rather than the Gravedigger or the Bodyguard.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Characters like the Saint would rather die at night than by execution. Since Outsiders are generally not targets a Alpha Wolf will want to kill, you can try to bait the Alpha Wolf into attacking them during the night.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you see that your two shown players are the Village Idiot, it is a good idea to communicate this early, especially if they think they are actually a character who receives information. Knowing that their information may be wrong is information in itself.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Alternatively, you can deliberately give false information about who the Village Idiot is - the Alpha Wolf is less likely to attack a player they think is the Village Idiot, which means that you can protect players who are sober and getting information while getting the Alpha Wolf to target the actual Village Idiot instead.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you see two players as the Village Idiot, remember that you might be the real village idiot!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Giving away your information freely will mean that the other player can trust you, but not that you can necessarily trust them - it is always possible they are an evil player simply agreeing with you to shore up their own bluff.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

<section class="mb-8">
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 alpha-wolf">Bluffing As</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You would have received your information on night one, and so should have it from that point onward. You will have been shown two players and one Outsider token.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You can use your information to back up a fellow evil player and make them look good. This lends credibility to their claim (especially if they are claiming to be a Saint or Recluse) and allows you to work with them directly as you are both 'good players' who know each other.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You can also use your information to back up a good player. A Saint who is having trouble being believed, or a Butler looking for someone to trust will appreciate a Librarian confirming them, and will be more willing to trust and vote with you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Naming two good players as the Village Idiot can cause them to doubt their information, or undermine powerful characters like the Mayor. The Village Idiot is a very safe option, since the people that you pick will not be able to confirm your information (at least for a while).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You can also name one of your fellow evil players as a potential Village Idiot. This means that if they mess up their bluff (e.g. giving information that doesn't make sense, dying as the Soldier) that's fine - they're obviously just the Village Idiot!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            As a show of confidence, immediately reveal which Outsider is 'in play' very early in the game, but don't name your 'players'. This can lead to a good player confirming your information, or it can allow an evil player to jump in and bluff if you are wrong.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you are the Spy or have access to a Spy, they can be invaluable in providing you accurate information to back up your story.</p>
