The game ends immediately and evil rejoices.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Like nearly all Outsiders in Sects & Violets, you should avoid dying if at all possible. Your ability is particularly nasty as it can end the game if you choose poorly, but it only becoming an issue if you actually die!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the good team is floundering, you can die deliberately and confirm someone as good by choosing them. Your ability yields incredibly powerful information for incredibly high risk. Knowing for sure that someone is good allows you to trust them completely, a very rare thing in this edition!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Before you die, work with the other players and try to find one alive player you believe is good, so you have a safe choice to pick in the event you accidentally die.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't pick players who are doubling up their character claim with another player - in most cases, a double up means one of the two is evil, which gives you a 50/50 chance to lose!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the group is keen to execute you, you can pre-empt the voting by loudly proclaiming which player you WILL choose as the Klutz after you die. If the group thinks that this player might be evil, they are less likely to kill you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you die, and choose a player, and the game does not end, you can be almost certain that that player is good. Since the Klutz is not affected by the Vortox, the No Dashii, and probably not by the Sweetheart or Philosopher, then you can safely assume that you are not village idiot or poisoned.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Bluffing As</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> Die! Getting yourself killed and then claiming to be the Klutz can be a game-changer. Some evil characters even naturally result in dead evil players as the game proceeds, which makes the Klutz an even more viable bluff than usual.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> When you 'choose a player' as the Klutz, you have a few options: Choose a player that you know to be good, and that the group thinks is good - this will endear you to the player in question, and make you look more trustworthy to the group.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> The Klutz is a good back-up bluff. Either stay quiet about your role or bluff as a different character, and then admit you are the Klutz later. Since this is what a real Klutz would do, you will be more believable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> A fun option for players fond of the long game is to tell one or two players in private that you are the Klutz while bluffing as something else publicly. This is a great way to build up trust with good players.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> Revealing you're the Klutz while still alive isn't optimal, but there's a couple of scenarios where it can become very necessary. For example, you might simply be trying to avoid execution!</p>
