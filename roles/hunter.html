    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 villager">Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Using your ability late in the game is far more effective than using it early in the game. When fewer people are alive, there is a greater chance that you will select the Alpha Wolf and win the game. Also, if fewer than five players are alive, then the Successor cannot become the Alpha Wolf after you kill it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            However, using your ability early in the game is better than not using your ability at all because you're dead. Most players will die before the final day arrives, so the odds that you'll also be dead by then are high. Make sure you use your ability before you die. The Alpha Wolf will want to kill you as soon as possible, so it is usually best to wait, then claim to be the Hunter only on the day that you intend to use your ability.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Coordinate with the other good players to help you select which player to choose. When you tell the group that you are the Hunter, you may find that many players reveal who they are and what information they have, so that you can make the best decision about who to slay. You can make particular use of a Seer's info to find people who might be the Alpha Wolf.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Most of the time, the player that you choose to slay will not be the Alpha Wolf. This is still useful to do, since you now know a player that is definitely NOT the Alpha Wolf. Knowing who the Alpha Wolf isn't is almost as useful as knowing who the Alpha Wolf is.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Sometimes, it can be useful to choose to slay a player, not because you think that they are the Alpha Wolf, but because you just want to make sure that they are not. For example, if a player is claiming to be the Saint, and is about to be executed, you can prove that they are not the Alpha Wolf by using your ability on them - if they don't die, you will probably want to execute somebody else instead!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            An advanced strategy can be to try to influence the Alpha Wolf's kills with your shot. If someone claims to be the Ravenkeeper, try to slay them. If they aren't the Alpha Wolf, the real Alpha Wolf will be forced to make a difficult choice: to kill them, and give them information, or to leave them alive late into the game with everyone knowing they aren't the Alpha Wolf?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            When you choose to use your ability, the Storyteller should allow a minute or so for the group to discuss who they think you should choose. They may give you advice, but it is always your decision. This period can be a good time to pretend to be 'about to choose' a particular player... just so you can watch to see how much they sweat under pressure. If, for example, you really want to slay the player claiming to be the Mayor, you can tell the group that you are really keen to choose the player claiming Soldier, but secretly you want to see how the Soldier player reacts before making your final choice.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you find a Bodyguard in play, convince them to protect you every night. This way, you can publicly claim to be the Hunter, safe in the knowledge that the Alpha Wolf can not kill you tonight. Whilst the Bodyguard is alive, you know you will always be alive tomorrow, so are under no pressure to use your ability today. If the Bodyguard dies at night, you are no longer safe, but if you die at night whilst the Bodyguard is still alive, then you know the player is not actually the Bodyguard.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Beware the Poisoner! If you publicly claim to be the Hunter, even if the Bodyguard is protecting you, you are a prime target for poisoning.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Your ability may work on the Recluse, since the Recluse might register as the Alpha Wolf. If your target dies, and claims to be the Recluse, then they might actually be the Recluse... or they could have been the Alpha Wolf, but had a Successor who is now the Alpha Wolf.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You can use your ability at any time during the day. There's no need to rush. You can even use it with the day about to end. On the block? Take your shot. Even if you don't have a clue who the Alpha Wolf is, it's better to have shot someone than to die unspent.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Remember that your ability only works on the Alpha Wolf. A person surviving your shot does not prove that they are good, merely that they are not the Alpha Wolf.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Be aware that the Alpha Wolf may change players throughout the game. If you choose to slay a Minion early in the game, nothing will happen, but that same player may be the Alpha Wolf by the end of the game.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 alpha-wolf">Bluffing As</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You would never wake in the night as the Hunter. Instead, you should publicly announce that you want to claim to be the Hunter, and the Storyteller will take care of the rest of your bluff for you. There is nothing tricky about this character as a bluff.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Nobody will ever die as a result of you 'using your Hunter ability'. With this in mind, there are a few ways you can choose to handle it: Deliberately slaying a Alpha Wolf or another evil player to make them look like they are not the Alpha Wolf, which can be useful for setting up bluffs. This is an especially good tactic when combined with the Successor, since the real Alpha Wolf can die and pass their ability to a player who has already been exonerated. Slaying a good player to confirm them as not the Alpha Wolf; this will enable you to 'trust' them, and will enable them to want to team up with you because of it. Alternatively, you can deliberately slay a good player, and then start to appear evil (e.g. Empath, setting yourself up to be read by an Gravedigger, etc.) Since you 'protected' a player from suspicion with your ability, they will appear evil as well.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Solicit the opinion of the group on who you should pick. Good players will be keen to help you make the right choice, and working with them will make you look good, also potentially coaxing information characters out from hiding who want to guide you to the right choice.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Hunter is a good 'backup bluff'. If you claim to be a character that is already in play, or you are otherwise under suspicion by the group, claiming that you were lying about who you were so that you could survive an extra day or two as the Hunter is believable - after all... that is what a real Hunter might very well do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Bluffing as a Hunter also works for good players! A Hunter with no ability is not a high priority target for the Alpha Wolf, enabling you to survive and continue secretly gathering information.</p>
