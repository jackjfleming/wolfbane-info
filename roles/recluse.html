    The Hunter uses their ability on the Recluse. The Storyteller decides that the Recluse registers as the Alpha Wolf, so the Recluse dies. The Hunter believes that they just killed the Alpha Wolf.
</div>

<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    The Empath, who neighbors the Recluse and the Bodyguard, learns she is neighboring one evil player. The next night, the Empath learns they are neighboring no evil players.
</div>

<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    The Investigator learns that either the Recluse or the Saint is the Successor.

<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    The Recluse is executed. The Gravedigger learns that the Alpha Wolf was executed.

<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    The Recluse neighbors the Alpha Wolf and an Evil Traveler. Because showing a "2" to the Chef might be too revealing, the Chef learns true information, a "0,” instead.

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 outsider">Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Tell everyone that you are the Recluse as soon as possible! This way, much of the good players' misinformation can be accounted for, such as that from the Chef, Empath or Investigator. Characters that get further information, like the Fortune Teller and Ravenkeeper will know not to choose you. However, if the group knows that you are the Recluse, they may want to execute you anyway.
</div>

<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Alternatively, stay silent about which character you are until the final day. If you can figure out which other players are Outsiders, or which characters you have been registering falsly to (hopefully not many), then you may be able to convince the group that you are actually an Outsider. Since the good team will often want to kill a Recluse, and this is not of benefit to the team as a whole, then staying alive by any means necessary is a helpful way to win.
</div>

<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Remember that you are a good player, and are therefore generally a worse choice of execution than any evil player. You also might register as evil even after you're dead - the Gravedigger will not get reliable information about you.
</div>

<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    You will usually register as evil - be suspicious of anyone saying otherwise. If you are sitting next to an Empath who is saying that both their neighbors are good, or if a Fortune Teller says you are not the Alpha Wolf, they are probably lying, and therefore evil. Similarly, anyone who claims to have information about you being evil can often be trusted.
</div>

<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Don't get Hunted! The Hunter will usually kill you if they select you, and this will make it look like you are the Alpha Wolf and a Successor is in play. This is not helpful to your team, and should be avoided at all costs. Similarly, avoid getting executed, since a Gravedigger will usually learn that you are a Minion or Alpha Wolf, confusing the good team even further.
</div>

<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Registering as evil can sometimes be quite helpful. Players who say that you are evil can often be trusted, and information like the Chef or Empath can be downright useful in helping you detect other evil players... if you can convince the group that you are not actually evil.
</div>

<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    If the players are incredibly suspicious of you, and very much want to execute you, it is best to accept your fate before the final day happens. You can even vote for yourself to make sure you are executed. If the group thinks you are evil, then dying before the final day at least confirms that you are not the Alpha Wolf, and will turn the good team's attention to other players. Dying on the second last day is safe. Dying on the last day means game over for you.

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 alpha-wolf">Bluffing As</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You would never wake, learn anything, or act during the day.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            'I'm not evil, I just register that way' - Since the Recluse registers as evil, it's a great excuse for you to be registering as evil. This can help you avoid heat from characters like the Empath, Seer and even the Investigator!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Be as helpful to the good team as possible. Tell them early that you are the Recluse and be proactive about finding other Outsiders, making sure information isn't confused, etc.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Use the Recluse as a backup bluff, or stay quiet about your claim for a while - you can eventually reveal and say you have been hiding to confuse evil players by hiding the existence of your Outsider status.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            As the Recluse continues to register as evil even when you are dead, you can maintain this bluff from beyond the grave, even when characters like the Gravedigger or Ravenkeeper have had a read on you.</p>
