    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> At the start of the game, your information is not very useful by itself, but can be extremely helpful when combined with the information of your allies. If you can find an Empath, or Seer, then knowing who is Good or Evil, or who is or is not the Alpha Wolf, can be very powerful.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If an Gravedigger sees that an Evil player was executed, you have information about their neighbours. If you got a '0', their neighbours are likely good, but you should be suspicious of them if you learnt anything higher.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Your information is gained on the first night, so you can reveal it immediately. This can help other information-gathering characters like the Empath or Seer to interpret their own information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you get a '0', this is fantastic information! It means that no evil players are sitting next to each other. This means that every evil player is surrounded by good players, which can help you narrow down who is evil.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you get a high number (like 3 or 4), this suggests that most evil players are sitting in a group. Look for a section of the circle where 3, 4, or 5 players are sitting next to each other, and most of them are probably evil.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Be wary of the Recluse! If you know that they're sat next to an Evil player, telling the group that there are Evil pairs may accidentally condemn your teammate to an early grave.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Bluffing As</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> You would have received your information on night one, and so should have it from that point onward. You would have been shown a number of fingers by the Storyteller.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> If you are sitting next to another evil player, claiming a number that is one lower than the actual number can help hide this fact. For example, if there are actually 2 pairs of evil players, but you and the Alpha Wolf are sitting next to each other, claiming that you saw '1' instead of '2' can help throw suspicion off of your evil neighbour.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> Claiming a high number when the actual number is low can cause the good team to become very suspicious of each other, and can cause them to execute good players who happen to be sitting next to other good players that seem suspicious.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> Be wary of the Recluse! If you know that they're sat next to an Evil player, telling the group that there are Evil pairs may accidentally condemn your teammate to an early grave.</p>
