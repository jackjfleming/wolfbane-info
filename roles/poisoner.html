            <p>The Poisoner poisons the Empath. The Empath wakes and learns a '1', but this information is false.</p>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Poisoner is unlikely to target you because of your ability on the first night, since they don't know anyone but their fellow evil players and will be acting blindly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Poison players that are giving information that is detrimental to the evil team. If the Empath is consistently giving accurate reads, or the Seer is homing in on the Alpha Wolf, poison them to stop the flow of information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Poison players with powerful abilities. The Hunter, Bodyguard, and Mayor all have game-changing abilities that you'll want to neutralize.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Consider poisoning players who have already used their ability, like the Housekeeper or Investigator, to make them appear to be the Village Idiot.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Be aware that some characters, like the Beggar, cannot be poisoned.</p>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You wake every night and choose a player to poison. You should have a story ready for who you've been poisoning each night.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Claim to have poisoned players who have given information that seems incorrect or suspicious. This can help explain away inconsistencies in the good team's information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you are executed and flip as the Poisoner, the good team will know that any information they received while you were alive might have been compromised.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Poisoner is a high-priority target for the good team, so expect to be executed if you claim to be one.</p>
