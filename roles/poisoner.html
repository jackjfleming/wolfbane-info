    During the night, the Poisoner poisons the Hunter. The next day, the Hunter tries to slay the Alpha Wolf. Nothing happens. The Hunter now has no ability.

    The poisoned Empath, who neighbors two evil players, learns a "0.” The next night, the Empath, no longer poisoned, learns the correct information: a "2.”

    The Investigator is poisoned. They learn that one of two players is the Baron, even though neither is a Minion. (Or even the right players, but the wrong Minion type.)

    The Gravedigger is poisoned. Even though the Alpha Wolf died today, they learn that the New in Town died. A few days later, a poisoned Saint dies, and the game continues.

    The Poisoner poisons the Mayor, then becomes the Alpha Wolf. The Mayor is no longer poisoned because there is no Poisoner in play.

    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Identifying targets for poison is vital. Characters who get information over several nights like the Seer or Gravedigger are great choices if you can find them. You can also make your choice based on the player; players who are strong leaders and rallying the good team or players who are quiet and trying not to attract attention are good options.
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Undermine players who trust each other by poisoning the characters getting key info in that clique. If a group is rallying around an Gravedigger, you can turn the entire group on someone innocent by poisoning them at the right time.
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Co-ordinate with your Alpha Wolf so that you are not selecting the same players - unless they are a character like the Ravenkeeper, you'll just be wasting your poison for the day!
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Targeting characters like the New in Town, Hunter or Mayor can be excellent, but only if they use their ability while they are poisoned. You'll need to convince them to use their ability, or time it right so that they are compromised at the moment they choose to activate.
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            It's risky, but you can poison your own Alpha Wolf, and use the lack of death for that night to bluff as the Bodyguard or Soldier. (You should probably warn your Alpha Wolf you're going to do this!)
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If everyone is on board with the idea, try poisoning the Successor. If the Alpha Wolfchooses to kill themselves, the Successor will become the new Alpha Wolf... unless you poison them first! That way, you or a third Minion can become the new Alpha Wolfand keep the Successor in play. Just don't get your Alpha Wolfkilled while the Successor is still poisoned!
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You will usually be more efficient as a Poisoner by selecting multiple targets around the town rather than focusing on one player for the entire game. You only really need to poison the Seer on the night they're checking your Alpha Wolf, for example - then you're free to mess with other characters. This method of poisoning is also more difficult to detect than sticking to one player.
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            On the other hand, if you only poison one player, that player might end up looking like the Village Idiot, perhaps hiding the real Village Idiot, or making it look like a Baron is in play.
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            On the first night, if you don't know who to poison, poison a player sitting next to the Alpha Wolf. You know which player is the Alpha Wolf, and on the off chance that an Empath is sitting next to the Alpha Wolf, you'll be giving some very damaging information to the good team.
        </div>

            Make use of your Spy! They know who the best targets are and can guide you in the right direction.

            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                The Poisoner is unlikely to target you because of your ability on the first night, since they don't know anyone but their fellow evil players and will be acting blindly. Therefore, you can usually trust that your ability will work correctly on the first night and day. This is particularly important for characters like the New in Town and the Hunter, who only get to use their abilities once, as well as the Housekeeper, Librarian, Investigator, and Chef.
            </div>

            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                The Poisoner will especially want to target characters who get information over multiple nights, such as the Empath, Gravedigger or Seer. They will also be keen to undermine characters like the Hunter, who can kill their Alpha Wolf. If you think a Poisoner is in play, be cautious about these characters and their information, especially if they have come out publicly. However, if you believe a player has been poisoned, you can usually assume they were given false information by the Storyteller.
            </div>

            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                If you are a character that would be unaffected by poison (e.g. Butler, Chef who has gotten their info), you can try to bluff as a juicy target for the Poisoner, ensuring that they don't target anyone else.
            </div>

            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                Separating the Poisoner from the Village Idiot can be crucial. Knowing that you have one in play might signal what else is in the game. Uncovering a Village Idiot might tell you that the Recluse is telling you the truth, or that the Butler might be lying. The Librarian or Investigator, Gravedigger, and Ravenkeeper can be the best ways to find out which is in play, but a lot of different people getting wrong information might point to the Poisoner.
            </div>

            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                Be alert for characters who suddenly start getting inconsistent information, especially if they have recently revealed to the group. For example, an Empath who is still sitting between the same neighbors but is suddenly getting a different number to the previous nights is likely poisoned.
            </div>

            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                In the absence of more obvious targets, poisoners typically will end up targeting players that are:<br>
                - Strong or outspoken, especially if they are rallying or leading the good team<br>
                - Friends or loved ones - it's hard to resist!<br>
                - Quiet, or are trying not to attract attention; these look like they have something to hide.
            </div>

            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                Unlike other Minions, the Poisoner is deadly throughout the entire game so long as they are alive. If you have a lead on a suspected Poisoner, it is always to your benefit to take them out as early in the game as possible. For example, an Investigator may know that one of two players is the Poisoner; it is best to execute them both. Alternatively, two players may be claiming to be the same character; this is usually an indication a Minion is doubling up with an existing good player, and eliminating both of them removes the Poisoner from contention.
            </div>

            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                Remember that the Poisoner causes information to be misleading, not wrong. If you learn that you might have been poisoned, you might still have had true information!
