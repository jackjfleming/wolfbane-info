            <p>The game is being set up for fifteen players, with nine Townsfolk, two Outsiders, three Minions, and one Alpha Wolf. Because the Baron is in play, the Storyteller must add a Village Idiot and a Recluse. So, they remove the Bodyguard token and add a Recluse token. Then, instead of adding the Village Idiot character token, they add the Village Idiot's 'Is the Village Idiot' reminder token to the Grimoire... because this game, one player isn't a Townsfolk—they are an Outsider: the Village Idiot. All these character tokens go into the bag for the players to draw from.</p>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Since you add Outsiders to the game, and those players will almost always publicly claim to be Outsiders, claiming to be an Outsider as well causes havoc.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Deliberately double up with an in-play character that you want to undermine. Since it does not matter if you die, claiming to be a Seer or an Gravedigger or even a Mayor when that character is already is in play, causes the good team to look upon you both with suspicion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Claiming that a Baron is in play when there is no Baron in play is a great strategy for the evil team. Claiming to be an Outsider means that the group conversation will turn to figuring out whether or not a Baron is in play.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Throw suspicion onto the Outsiders. If you can make the good team think that the Outsiders you added are evil, they will chase their tails looking for signs of a Poisoner or Successor!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Be a patsy. If you are executed, the Alpha Wolf is not. Don't be afraid to die this way, since it gives the Alpha Wolf a day of safety.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You don't always have to be the fall guy. The last thing you want is for you to look evil and have the Alpha Wolf to kill themselves and have you as their only escape route!</p>

    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Baron's ability happens during setup, and it cannot be changed. What this means is that unlike other evil players, it isn't completely necessary to execute them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you believe the Outsiders, but the count isn't quite right, then one of the Townsfolk is probably a Village Idiot, and you should be trying to figure out who they are as soon as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Librarian, Investigator, Ravenkeeper and Gravedigger are all characters that greatly help you deduce the presence of a Baron.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Unlike other Minions, the effect the Baron has on the game is pretty obvious; you will soon notice if there are Outsiders when there shouldn't be, or more of them when expected.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Because they don't benefit as much from staying alive as much as other Minions, Barons will often tend to be bolder and more aggressive with their bluffs or plays.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Unlike the other Minions, the Baron's effect on the game happens before anything else and cannot be changed. What this means is that unlike other evil players, it isn't completely necessary to execute them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Don't forget that the Alpha Wolf can pass on their Alpha Wolfhood to a Baron! Ignoring the Baron until it is too late might put you in a difficult position of trying to figure out if they have become the Alpha Wolf on the final day.</p>
