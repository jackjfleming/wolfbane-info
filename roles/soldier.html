    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 villager">Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If the Alpha Wolf attacks you, nobody dies this night. This has two benefits. Firstly, since no good player has died at night, there are more players alive than there ought to have been, allowing the good team more time to execute. Secondly, no death of a night time supports your claim that you are indeed the Soldier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You will never know for sure that your ability has worked. If you wake up to no deaths, perhaps there is a Bodyguard in play, or the Alpha Wolf decided to take a night off terrorising the living and attack someone's already dead corpse. Both of those look identical to the Alpha Wolf attacking you in the night.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Consider bluffing as a juicy Alpha Wolf target, such as the Seer, Gravedigger, Empath or Hunter, to attract a Alpha Wolf attack.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you can prove that you are the Soldier, then the good team has an enormous advantage on the final day. Instead of good choosing between three (or four) players to execute, they will be choosing between two (or three). Getting an Empath or Seer to confirm you as not the Alpha Wolf can be very helpful.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            A clever Alpha Wolf will not attack you again after the first time unless they think they can kill you. If you can convince the Alpha Wolf that a Bodyguard protected you, the Alpha Wolf might try to attack you again.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If there are no deaths at night, don't immediately claim to be the Soldier! Perhaps the Alpha Wolf attacked another player protected by the Bodyguard and has no idea you were ever protected.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you are unsure whether they are good or evil, allow powerful information characters to bluff as your role. This way, the Alpha Wolf is more likely to attack you, and less likely to attack them. You can even talk with these players secretly, and agree to publicly claim to be each others' characters - they stay safe, whilst you reveal their information to the group.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you die at night, you were either poisoned by the Poisoner, or you are the Village Idiot. This is big information, and very helpful for the group to know. If you were poisoned, then a Poisoner is still alive (and in a one Minion game, you now know which Minion is in play!), which also gives you information about the alignment of the dead players. If you are the Village Idiot, then nobody else can be the Village Idiot. Either way, you learn something useful.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Tell the group you are the Soldier at some stage during the game. After all, good will need as much information as they can get at their disposal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you have told nobody that you are the Soldier, you are still alive on the final day, and a death has occurred every night so far, then it is probable that a Spy is in play and telling the Alpha Wolf who to attack. If you notice this happening, pay attention to who is whispering to who.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you never tell anyone who you are, your role can combo in a very risky way with the Mayor. You might be more confident to execute nobody in final three than anyone else in your position. Even if the Alpha Wolf is pretending to be the Mayor, and you execute no one, evil hasn't won yet! The Alpha Wolf still has to kill either you or the other surviving player, and just maybe they'll guess wrong, and you will wake to a second day with just three players alive.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 alpha-wolf">Bluffing As</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Soldier never wakes, and never acts during the day. You would receive no indication that you were ever attacked. You have no information at all to keep track of.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Soldier is an easy bluff, as you don't give any information and your alleged ability explains your longevity as the game goes on. This does not mean you should rest on your laurels though; because you have no information, people may eventually become suspicious of you as the options narrow. A Soldier who is trying to help good (by bluffing as a juicy target like the Seer for the Alpha Wolf to kill, for example) can carry more favor than a Soldier sitting quietly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Staying quiet and trying not to draw attention to yourself is the mark of a powerful character... or a Soldier trying to draw the attention of a Alpha Wolf. Sitting quietly and acting cagey about your ability for a few days makes it look like you are genuinely trying to get targeted.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You (or your Alpha Wolf) can choose to kill an already dead player at night. This will give the illusion that no death actually occurred, allowing you to claim that you were targeted instead.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Because it cannot die at night, information characters often can and will bluff as the Soldier. You can gain the trust of a player doing this by 'revealing' yourself as the true Soldier, and offering to swap characters with them in order to keep them alive longer while making yourself more of a target. (Bonus: If you have a Poisoner in play, keep this player alive while completely undermining their ability!)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Soldier cannot die at night (unless poisoned or actually the Village Idiot). If you die, you'd best have a good explanation ready for why that happened!</p>
