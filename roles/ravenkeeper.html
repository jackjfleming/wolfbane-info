            <p>The Ravenkeeper is killed by the Alpha Wolf, and then wakes to choose a player. After some deliberation, they choose Benjamin. Benjamin is the Empath, and the Ravenkeeper learns this.</p>

            <p>The Alpha Wolf attacks the Mayor. The Mayor doesn't die, but the Ravenkeeper dies instead, due to the Mayor's ability. The Ravenkeeper is woken and chooses Douglas, who is a dead Recluse. The Ravenkeeper learns that Douglas is the Successor, since the Recluse registered as a Minion.</p>

    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If the Alpha Wolf knows you are the Ravenkeeper, they are very unlikely to kill you. It is to your benefit to bluff as a character who is a constant threat to the evil team, such as the Empath, Seer, Hunter, or Gravedigger. Even bluffing as a good character that tends to be trusted by the good team (such as Chef or Housekeeper) can make you look like a trusted good player in the eyes of the Alpha Wolf, and attract their attention at night.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Ravenkeeper gets some of the best information in Trouble Brewing. Think about whose character you would like to learn before each night falls. You won't want to make a hasty decision and choose wildly in the moment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You may want to tell the group that you are the Ravenkeeper first thing on the first day. This will almost guarantee that you are still alive on the final day, as the Alpha Wolf will probably not kill you. This strategy means that you have more power in the late game (since living players may vote more than dead players), but you sacrifice the chance of gaining information by your death. Additionally, claiming Ravenkeeper is the sort of thing a Hunter or Gravedigger might do early game, so it might just get you killed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you get to use your ability by dying at night, tell the group you are the Ravenkeeper the following day. Your information will be immediately useful.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you see a good token, consider keeping that information private. If the Alpha Wolf knows that you know that a player is good, that player becomes a much higher priority target, and you want the player you trust alive as long as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you have told nobody that you are the Ravenkeeper, and you are still alive late in the game, then it is probable that a Spy is in play, telling the Alpha Wolf who to attack. If you notice this happening, pay attention to who is whispering to whom.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 alpha-wolf">Bluffing As</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Ravenkeeper would wake only when they die during the night, not the day. They would wake up and choose a player, then be shown a character token.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Ravenkeeper is a fantastic bluff if you intend to pass the torch at some point to a Minion, or otherwise die protecting the Alpha Wolf. Dying at night tends to make a player look good, and having information as a result of your death can allow you to throw blame, protect a fellow evil player, or make yourself look extremely trustworthy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Throwing blame allows you to point the finger at a good player as an evil one - casting doubt on them, their information, and who they trust.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Finally, you can back up a good player's claim, which will get them to trust you and work with you. For example, if you know a player is the Empath, claim you chose them and saw the Empath token.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Don't know the identity of the player you are confirming? Claim that person is the Village Idiot. This will also cast doubt on their information, adding an extra layer of usefulness to the strategy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Ravenkeeper is a fantastic bluff if you are trying to stay alive for the whole game. As the Alpha Wolf will not want to kill a Ravenkeeper, you can claim that you are still alive in the late game because the Alpha Wolf discovered your identity somehow (perhaps via the Spy, or just some good ol' fashioned eavesdropping).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You only get information if you die, so be careful about who you choose to confirm. Dying as a Ravenkeeper usually takes some effort, and if you then appear to 'waste' that on a Chef that nobody doubts, you will look suspicious.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Ravenkeeper is a great bluff to fall back on in the event that your bluff as a different character falls apart. Bluffs like the Seer, Gravedigger or Empath can all run into trouble if you don't appear to have the right information, but if you reveal you were the Ravenkeeper all along, suddenly your duplicity will make sense.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Some powerful characters will openly bluff as your character to protect themselves. Revealing yourself as the 'real' Ravenkeeper and allowing them to keep the bluff can help you build trust with a good player while finding ways to undermine their ability.</p>
