 <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Stay alive, however you can. Lay low and don't tempt the Alpha Wolf into attacking you. Avoid getting exiled until after your ability triggers. If you can live long enough for you to die in place of an executed player, that helps enormously. The Storyteller will often wait for the second half of the game for your ability to make your ability trigger, so be patient, and play it safe.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    When the Storyteller declares that the players kill you instead of the normal executee, this is great! Talk to the player you saved in private. You know that they are good, and they know that you are good. Work together, vote together, and win together. Encourage them to tell you any information that they have due to their character ability, and any information that they have due to other private conversations they have had. Do whatever you can to keep this player alive, and save your vote for when they vote too.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Vote liberally, and try to convince others to do the same. If you execute an evil player, that's great! The Alpha Wolf will often bluff as a powerful information-gathering character that the good team doesn't want to execute, so taking a chance on executing the Fortune Teller might help your teammate enormously. If you execute a good player, you might be executed instead, which is what you want - you can keep that very real Fortune Teller alive!
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    After you have talked to the player whose life you saved, do whatever you can to convince the rest of the group that they are good. You have two publicly known facts to help you do this: Most Travelers are good. The odds that you are good, are good, therefore the odds that the player you saved is good, are good. Both you and the player you saved are the same alignment. If there is a Chef or Empath in play, their information would need to be congruent with you both being the same alignment. If an Investigator or Fortune Teller is in-play, their information may be incongruent with you both being evil. It is rare that a piece of information such as "two players are the same alignment" becomes publicly known, so use it to the full.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Beware of the Spy! If they get the votes, you, the poor, innocent, good Scapegoat might be executed instead! You at least learn that they weren't the Alpha Wolf when you were executed, so it's not all bad news!
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Feeling devious? Go up to a player you don't trust and tell them you're evil. Convince them to get themselves executed so you can 'prove' you're on the same team - only to watch them get executed for their crime of believing you. One Minion (or even Alpha Wolf!) down.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    To help convince the group that you are good, make the argument that another Traveler in the game is evil. Whether they are actually good or evil doesn't really matter to you. What does matter is that if the group thinks that one of them is evil, they will believe that you are good, because the chance of there being 2 evil Travelers is small. A group that believes that you are the good Traveler will keep you alive long enough for you to use your ability, and will believe that the player whose life you save is good too. And you never know, maybe the Traveler that you are throwing under the bus actually is evil after all!

    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Stay alive, however you can. So that the Alpha Wolf doesn't kill you, either talk to the Alpha Wolf to let them know that you are evil, or otherwise get a message to them. Avoid getting exiled no matter the cost. The Storyteller will almost always wait until the Alpha Wolf is executed for your ability to trigger, so you remaining alive until that happens will save the evil team from defeat. Sometimes, the Storyteller will make your ability trigger when a Minion is executed instead. If this happens, that's still great, because at least that Minion gets another night and day in the game.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    You are that rare beast, an evil traveler who can prove themselves evil to their Alpha Wolf! If they get the votes and you're executed instead, they know that you must be their ally!
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    If the good team begins to think that you are evil, it may be best to die. Either get yourself exiled, or get the Alpha Wolf to kill you. If you live, and your ability triggers when a Minion dies, the good team will believe that the Minion you saved is in fact evil. This may give them all the information they need to deduce who the Alpha Wolf is.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    When the Storyteller declares that the players kill you instead of the normal executee, this is great! Talk to the player you saved in private, just as if you were a good player. You can talk about the weather, football, whatever. As long as the good team believes that you are good, they will believe that the player you saved is good. If this player is the Alpha Wolf, this strategy could win you the game. If this player is a Minion, they get to keep their ability and their daily voting power.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    If the game is near to a close, and you died in place of a Minion, it may be best if you look as evil as possible to the group. The following day, if just 3 or 4 players are left alive, the good team will probably execute the player you saved, believing them to be the Alpha Wolf. If you look evil, the good team thinks that the Minion is evil, and may not click that they are not in fact the Alpha Wolf. This strategy may still be useful if 5, 6, or even 7 players are still alive. Convincing the group to execute a Minion (again) at least means that they are not executing the Alpha Wolf, and good loses precious time and votes in the process.
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
    Do whatever you can to convince the rest of the group that the player whose life you saved is good. This may be an uphill struggle, depending on the number of other Travelers in play. Since the group will know for a fact that you are both the same alignment, they may be able to  use this information to prove or disprove other player's alignments. Pay attention, and focus on discrediting key players. For example, if the Alpha Wolfjust got executed but saved by you, and the Empath is sitting next to you and knows that one of their neighbors is evil, you will need to completely discredit either the Empath, or their other living neighbor... otherwise it's curtains for team evil.
