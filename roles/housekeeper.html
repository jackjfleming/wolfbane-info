    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 villager">Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Housekeeper is deceptively powerful. Even though you don't gain information on the evil players, you can confirm the identity of a good player. This player should be your focus for the game, because if they have great information, then you have that information too. If they have a useful ability that they choose to use, you can help them use it wisely.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            When the Housekeeper is poisoned or is actually the Village Idiot, they will often get information that is easy to figure out is incorrect—at least compared to other characters. While the Chef has no clue as to whether their '1' is incorrect, if both of the players the Storyteller pointed at tell you they're a different character to the one the Storyteller showed you, it is likely that you are the Village Idiot or poisoned.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You know that of the two players you are shown, one must be the Townsfolk you are shown. Importantly, this means that you know that the person you see is not the Village Idiot.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            To find out which of the two players is the Townsfolk, either ask the group publicly or have a private conversation with each player individually. It is usually best to reveal what you know before the Townsfolk in question says who they are so they trust you more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If you share your information on the first day, and speak up quickly, the good team has some solid information to begin with. This is particularly useful if you confirm another information-receiving Townsfolk like the Empath or the Seer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Waiting until the final day - or at least very late in the game - to share your information with the group can also be very useful. If you can keep the Townsfolk that you know alive until the final day, then you know one player who is not the Alpha Wolf!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Talk to the Townsfolk player that you know, and secretly let them know that you know who they are. This way, you can hopefully form an alliance, and can come to each other's defence if either of you are nominated for execution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            After talking to the Townsfolk that you know in private, and confirming who they are, you can tell the group that they are a different character than they actually are. This strategy is useful if you want to protect a powerful Townsfolk from characters like the Poisoner.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You can claim to be a more powerful character than you actually are. You start with all the information you're going to get, so if the Alpha Wolf kills you, they aren't killing the Hunter or the Seer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You could claim to be the Housekeeper and point to a player you suspect is evil, stating that they are the Townsfolk you learned about. An opportunistic evil player may pounce on an opportunity to appear good.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Beware of the Spy! They may register as a Townsfolk character to you. That player who you think is the Investigator may not be the Investigator after all...</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Remember that while the Spy is likely to know that you've seen them as a Townsfolk, they won't know which Townsfolk you've seen them as.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 alpha-wolf">Bluffing As</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            You would have received your information on night one, and so should have it from that point onward. You will have been shown two players and one Townsfolk token.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Claim to be the Housekeeper and point to at least one evil player. Then, name the Townsfolk character (preferably one that you suspect/know is not in play).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            If a good player claims to be a particular Townsfolk character, you can claim to be the Housekeeper, and confirm that they are who they say they are.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            Immediately upon awakening, tell the group that a particular Townsfolk is in play. Cross your fingers and hope that you are correct!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            The Housekeeper can be a difficult bluff, because sometimes the Townsfolk you say is in play, isn't. If this happens, you can always claim to be the Village Idiot or poisoned.</p>
