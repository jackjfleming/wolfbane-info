    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 villager">Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Your power activates on the final day, when just three players are alive. You may not know who the Alpha Wolf is, but you can definitely win by not executing. Do whatever you can to convince the group that you are the Mayor. Everything. If the good team believes you, they will either not nominate anybody, or will deliberately tie votes so that no execution occurs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> It is often best not to reveal that you are the Mayor until late in the game. If you reveal early, the Alpha Wolf may spend night after night trying to kill you, and the Storyteller may let that attempt succeed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You might want to tell people that you're the Mayor. Winning the game with your ability requires trust from your fellow players, and being open and honest is a fine way to achieve that trust.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When a character that's an unlikely target for the Alpha Wolf to pick dies at night, such as the Butler, this may be an indication that you were attacked instead. When convincing other players that you are the Mayor, you can use this as evidence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Once the Alpha Wolf attacks you and somebody else dies, they will know for sure that you are the Mayor. At the very beginning of each morning, if a particular player looks surprised and confused, they are likely to be the Alpha Wolf!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you intend to use your ability to win the game by not executing, do everything you can to make sure you are not actually the Village Idiot. Spend the game listening to other players, and verifying that any Outsiders are actually Outsiders. If you think a Village Idiot is in play, you will need to figure out who it is, because if it is you, and you don't execute on the final day, evil wins. Similarly, if the only other players alive are the Alpha Wolf and the Poisoner, then you will certainly be poisoned. You will need to make sure that the Poisoner is dead before using your Mayor ability.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 alpha-wolf">Bluffing As</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> The Mayor would never wake at night. You would never learn if you were targeted and caused another player to die instead.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> The Mayor has a good reason to survive at night, which you can use to explain your longevity as other players die. This makes it a great bluff for a Alpha Wolf in particular.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> Come out to a few players in private early on in the game, so that when you eventually reveal you have some backup that you're not just coming out with this claim out of nowhere.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> The Mayor is a fantastic fallback if another bluff doesn't work out. Coming out on the final day as the Mayor who was 'in hiding' can alleviate suspicion that you may have come under if your Seer information wasn't adding up.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> Deliberately setting up a kill of a character that isn't 'optimal' can be used as evidence for a Mayor being in play. For example, you can target a Recluse, or a Housekeeper who has already given their information; both are normally low priority for the Alpha Wolf, and so you can argue that this was a redirected kill from your ability.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> As a good player, bluffing as the Mayor can get the Alpha Wolf to target you, since they will either suspect you are a more powerful character bluffing as the Mayor to survive, or they just want to confirm the existence of a Mayor overall.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> Good players are more likely to risk winning with the Mayor if they have no better leads. Coordinate with your evil team to keep confusion high so that on the final day, good does not feel like they have a clear path to victory.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>Bluffing:</strong> If you are nominated on the final day, don't despair! Unlike a regular bluff where you must beat the votes against you, a Mayor can call for the town to tie the vote instead, since that will cause no execution, allowing the Mayor ability to activate normally.</p>
