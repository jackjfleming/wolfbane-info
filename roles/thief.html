            <p>The Thief chooses Marianna. The next day, while tallying the first vote, the Storyteller counts '1... 2... 3... 2... 3... 4... 5.' The nominated player now has five votes for their execution, and the nomination process continues.</p>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p>The Thief chooses Abdallah. Abdallah votes for an execution, and instead of the tally being six, it is four. Since 10 players are alive, the nominee is not executed today. Later that day, the players are voting to exile the Gunslinger. Abdallah votes to exile, and his vote counts as positive.</p>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're good:</strong> Use your ability to undermine players who you believe are evil! Secretly pick a player you suspect at night, and do not let them know tomorrow that their vote is now negative. When this player votes, they'll be voting with the expectation that they'll be counting towards the vote, when in fact they'll be undermining whatever cause they're working for.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're good:</strong> Weaponize your negativity - pick a player you believe to be good, and tell them about it! While this does mean one less good vote on the table, this player now has the very powerful ability to vote against a nomination.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're good:</strong> Swap up who you are picking, especially if you're trying to pick evil players. Once a player knows their vote counts negatively, they can use it to their advantage. To avoid this, change who you pick each night, moving the negative vote around and keeping players guessing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're good:</strong> Double and triple bluff who you picked publicly. Players who believe their vote counts negatively will react differently to players who think their vote is normal. With the power of words alone, you can be able to convince an evil player not to vote at a critical juncture.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're good:</strong> Remember that you can pick dead players if you want to. This is particularly useful on the final day, since that is when most dead players will be using their single vote.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're good:</strong> Keep quiet about who you pick so nobody knows what to expect! This will often mean that players you want to execute, don't get executed, which is an unfortunate downside. However, when each player first votes each day, you can observe their reaction and body language.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're good:</strong> If a Bureaucrat is in play, and you think that they are good, co-ordinate with them and both choose the same player, giving a whopping 3 negative votes to a player of your choice.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 alpha-wolf">Tips & Tricks (If Evil)</h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're evil:</strong> Pick good players who are figuring out who is good and who is evil, but don't tell them that you have stolen their vote. They will vote for executions that they want to pass, and this will often mean that they are voting for good players.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're evil:</strong> Lie about who you chose. This will cause confusion and trick the good players into making executions fail when they don't want them to. If a player believes that they have a negative vote, they will vote when they want an execution to fail, but accidentally increase its chances of succeeding instead.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're evil:</strong> Pick evil players, and tell them that you have picked them. Evil players know exactly who is good and who is evil, so will always use their negative vote effectively. You may need to swap between evil players - choosing the Alpha Wolf one night, then choosing a Minion the next night.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p><strong>If you're evil:</strong> On the final day, you definitely want to choose an evil player, and have them know that you have chosen them. Even if the good team exiles you after the fact, having a negative vote on the Alpha Wolf is incredibly helpful. It may even win you the game!</p>
